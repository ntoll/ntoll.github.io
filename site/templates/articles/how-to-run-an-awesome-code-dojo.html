<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/atroche">Alistair Roche</a> recently <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/atroche/status/161775174604173312">tweeted</a> the following question:</p>

<blockquote>@ntoll Hey Nicholas, any chance I could get some advice from you on how to run an awesome coding dojo?</blockquote>

<p>This blog post is my answer.</p>

<p>I helped start the London Python Code Dojo with <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/tartley">Jonathan Hartley</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/otfrom">Bruce Durling</a> because I was learning Python and wanted to meet people I could learn from. Therein lies the essence of the dojo: a place to learn with/from other people.</p>

<p>The original dojo concept is explained at the <a href="http://codingdojo.org/">codingdojo.org</a> website. We started out with every intention of following the instructions. However, we've let our imaginations run and evolved the meetings to our group's dynamics and interests. If you run a dojo, so should you too (adapt).</p>

<p>Whereas codingdojo.org is quite formal and focussed on test-driven development (TDD) we have changed things in three major ways:</p>

<ol>

<li>expand the pair programming "randori" to encompass groups of no more than five participants</li>

<li>drop the TDD dogma, and</li>

<li>encouraged noise, debate and creativity.</li>

</ol>

<p>Working in groups was suggested by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ciaranmooney">Ciar&aacute;n</a> and makes the dojo a software version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrapheap_Challenge">Scrapheap Challenge</a>. Every group is given about an hour and a half to solve the same problem, at the end of the evening each group does a show and tell which ends up being a public code review cum question and answer session.</p>

<p>Although I practice TDD I personally dislike pushing any "one true" methodology on people. There are times when TDD is the worst thing to do (I'll explain why in another blog post) and I personally feel it's important to let people discover so-called good practice for themselves by observing it in use rather than being told to do it.</p>

<p>It soon became clear that encouraging noise, debate and "creativity" leads to a buzz in the room and lots of energetic intellectual interaction between participants. I once overheard someone (it might have been <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/tomviner">Tom Viner</a> but I might be wrong) explain that the London Python code dojo is to the original dojo concept as an improvisation in a jazz club is to a string quartet recital.</p>

<p>So here's the London dojo recipe:</p>

<ul>

<li>We limit the number of tickets to around thirty to make the evening easier to manage (it's like herding cats).</li>

<li>Start with a social element. For us it's pizza and beer. Not only is it a good way to welcome new members but it is also a great community building mechanism. Several people have found jobs via the connections made in the pre-code social.</li>

<li>During the social element we encourage people to write ideas for the evening's problem on a white/black-board or flip chart. Good ideas are usually algorithmic in nature and very specific. Recent examples include:

<ul>

<li>Game solving algorithms: Boggle, Mastermind and Tic-Tac-Toe.</li>

<li>Creating a simple game: Hunt the Wumpus clone.</li>

<li>Problem solving: Maze navigation.</li>

<li>An adventure game where each month we create a new aspect of the game: world representation, parser, keeping game state, puzzles and so on.</li>

</ul>

Sometimes we start the evening with a presentation of some sort of problem or Python module and we use that as the basis of the group coding. For example, we all created animated Christmas cards with PyGame.

</li>

<li>The "organiser" convenes the coding session by calling for a vote on the problems suggested during the social part of the evening. We usually work out the top three ideas then take a second vote to decide a winner.</li>

<li>The "organiser" randomly assigns everyone a group.</li>

<li>There follows one and a half hours of furious coding with the organiser calling out half-hour intervals.</li>

<li>Finally, once the time is up every group does a show and tell where we need to see their code running (or not as the case may be) followed by a code review. For me, this is the best (and funniest) part of the evening.</li>

</ul>
