<h1>AIMLBot Version 3.0 Roadmap and other projects...</h1>
<p class="published_on">Tuesday 31 July 2007 (10:16PM)</p>


	<p>I have some time on my hands in the evenings at the moment so I hope to do some extensive re-factoring and development on the AIMLBot project. </p>

	<p>My most important aims and objectives are:</p>

	<ul>

		<li>To update the library's <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym> to make it even simpler, efficient and useful.</li>

		<li>Get rid of all the "cruft" that seems to have built up around the project (all those bloated examples). I'm going to re-focus on the core library.</li>

		<li>Write better produced documentation and code examples.</li>

		<li>Re-license the whole project under duel licenses:

	<ul>

		<li>A free "open-source" license for free-software and educational use.</li>

		<li>A commercial license (that will cost money).</li>

	</ul></li>

		<li>Make use of some of the new features in <a href="http://www.netfx3.com/">.NET 3.0</a> (interfacing with the Windows Workflow Foundation, <acronym title="Windows Communication Foundation">WCF</acronym> and Cardspace).</li>

		<li>Provide several "free" clients as:

	<ul>

		<li>A standard "stand-alone" Windows application</li>

		<li>A click-one application</li>

		<li>An ASP.NET/AJAX.NET custom control</li>

		<li>A <a href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a> application</li>

		<li>A Vista client written in <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms752059.aspx">XAML</a> that makes use of the new <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/01/speechinWindowsVista/">speech and voice recognition</a> APIs.</li>

		<li>A <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">GTK/Mono</a> client for Linux/Mac OS X</li>

	</ul></li>

		<li>Build a set of commercial applications upon the core library:

	<ul>

		<li>An easy to use GUI for AIML editing and bot configuration delivered as either:

	<ul>

		<li>A standard Windows application</li>

		<li>A click-once application</li>

		<li>A web application (<a href="http://www.asp.net/">ASP.NET</a> or within <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint/default.mspx">Sharepoint</a>)</li>

		<li>A Silverlight application</li>

	</ul></li>

		<li>A scalable, high performance server to which the above applications can connect and configure.</li>

		<li>A lightweight "mobile" stand-alone program AND/OR client</li>

	</ul></li>

		<li>A set of commercially available extensions to mash-up with:

	<ul>

		<li><a href="http://www.opencyc.org/">OpenCYC</a></li>

		<li>The new <a href="http://www.freebase.com/signin/signin">Freebase</a> service</li>

		<li><a href="http://wf.netfx3.com/">Windows Workflow Foundation</a></li>

		<li>Various other services / applications that I'm still researching</li>

	</ul></li>

		<li>To add extensions to the basic AIML set (AIML will always be supported in "compatibility mode"), details of which will be forthcoming.</li>

	</ul>

	<p>Finally, you may remember I was working on an <a href="http://ntoll.org/article/talenttool-and-technology">HR application</a> and <a href="http://ntoll.org/article/a-web-based-expert-system">expert system</a>. Well, the HR application is now shelved for good. It was an excellent vehicle for me to learn about <a href="http://microformats.org/">Microformats</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a> and Ruby-on-Rails so was not without its benefits. The work I've done on the expert system will be incorporated into the Windows Workflow Foundation research I've been doing with a view to applying it to version 3.0 of AIMLBot.</p>
