<p><small>(This article is based upon a short talk I gave at
<a href="http://www.opentech.org.uk/2013/">Opentech</a> 2013.)</small></p>

<p><img src="/static/images/drogulus.png" alt="Drogulus logo"/></p>

<p>I'm going to describe the <a href="http://drogul.us">drogulus</a>: a
programmable peer-to-peer data store that I've been hacking on in my spare
time.</p>

<p>The problem I have is a growing unease with the current state of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">web</a>. This unease can
be summed up in three ways:</p>

<ol>
    <li><em>On the web, users are no longer in control of their data or online
    identity.</em> They're locked in to websites that act as walled gardens of
    data each of which requires different credentials in order to log in. Once
    logged in there is often no way to extract data. Furthermore, how can we
    tell who's who? Is <em>user X</em> on Twitter the same <em>user X</em> on
    Facebook?</li>

    <li><em>Programmers have to build stuff on the web using complicated and
    quirky technology defined in a top down manner by committee.</em> Just
    watch any web developer grimace if you mention
    <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">OAuth</a>,
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">CORS</a>, Javascript
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date">date objects</a>
    or (dare I say it)
    <a href="http://www.ie6countdown.com/">Internet Explorer</a>.</li>

    <li><em>There are many inadvertent points of control, lock-in and authority
    built in to the web - each of which is a potential mechanism for
    dis-empowerment and exploitation</em>. Just look at the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall_of_China#Technical_implementation">great firewall of China</a>,
    the censorship of the
    <a href="http://unblockedpiratebay.com/">Piratebay</a>
    here in the UK or the kerfuffle over payment to
    <a href="http://wikileaks.org/">Wikileaks</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The beautifully simple, open and decentralised hypertext system envisioned
by Tim Berners-Lee has grown in to a closed, centralised and complicated
monster beholden to dodgy commercial, political and legal manipulation. More
worryingly still, our data is analyzed by companies, sold via targeted
advertising or handed over to governments without our consent.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many aspects of today's web are contrary to a concept that is
very important to me: autonomy.</p>

<p>When someone is autonomous they are self-directing, free to act of their own
accord and lack imposition from others. Autonomy also suggests intelligence and
awareness enough to be able to enjoy and make use of such freedom. Furthermore,
such intelligence entails decision making so people become accountable for
their actions. Autonomy is also the opposite of such undesirable states as
tyranny, slavery, ignorance and apathy.</p>

<p>I asked myself, how would software designed to promote autonomy function? I
started to hack and the drogulus was born.</p>

<p>The drogulus is a speculative exercise in
<a href="/article/p2p-concise-and-simple">peer-to-peer</a> decentralisation, a
political statement (it promotes a certain point of view about technology's
role in society) and is a place for me to explore fun ideas that have been
knocking around in my head for a while.</p>

<p>I tell myself, "it'll all come to nothing" but I'm having too much fun to
stop, so I want to tell you about the drogulus to give you a sense of why I
find it so fascinating.</p>

<p>So, how is the drogulus designed to promote digital autonomy?</p>

<p>It's a global federated, decentralized and open data store that can be
programmed by anyone. Identity and provenance is ensured by
<a href="http://ntoll.org/article/public-key-crypto-concise-and-simple">cryptographically signing</a>
digital assets.</p>

<p>Being federated (the system consists of many independent but collaborating
entities) and decentralized (no entity is more important than the others)
ensures users are free from choke points of authority that may be used to
control access to data and usage of the system.</p>

<p>Being an open system means all users are free to contribute, change, enhance
and expand the system without prejudice.</p>

<p>Being programmable means users can do something with the data stored within
the drogulus. It's a sort of distributed programming environment. Imagine it as
a re-configurable <a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">SETI@home</a>
on steroids: by running a node in the drogulus network you are sharing a small
amount of your potential computing power with everyone else on the network.</p>

<p> By using public key cryptography the drogulus ensures the provenance of the
data and that it has not been tampered with. Importantly, there is no central
authority to prove who's who. Identity is built on the far more humane
mechanism of a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">web of trust</a>.</p>

<p>So how does it work? Well, there are three simple core components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">distributed
  hash table</a> (DHT) that provides the data store and allows users to find
  each other.</li>
  <li>Trust and identity enforced by the afore mentioned
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature">cryptographic
  signing</a> of digital assets.</li>
  <li>Logos
  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</a>),
  a simple
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a>
  like programming language for asynchronously working with data stored in the
  distributed hash table.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each component promotes autonomy in the following ways:</p>

<p>A distributed hash table works like a sort of peer-to-peer dictionary: a
unique key is used to identify a value. In the case of a traditional
dictionary, the key is a word and the value is its definition. Being a data
store, the distributed hash table allows users to create, retrieve, update and
delete their own keys and associated digital values.</p>

<p>The hash table is distributed because it is split in to the equivalent of
many volumes of a traditional dictionary. Each person who ever uses the
dictionary has a copy of just one volume with many copies of the same volume
being distributed to many different users.</p>

<p>Users keep track of which of their friends on the network hold what volume.
Users interact with the distributed hash table by contacting the friend with
the correct volume for the desired item. If they don't know anyone with the
right volume they play a sort of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation">six-degrees-of-separation</a>
game with their friends until someone with the correct volume is found.</p>

<p>Distributed hash tables also share an interesting property with
<a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/">Bittorrent</a>: the more popular an entry
is the more widespread it becomes, thus improving performance since popular
items are easier to find.</p>

<p>The drogulus implements a version of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia</a> distributed hash
table algorithm. The innovation the drogulus brings is that keys and values are
signed in such a way that their provenance can be proven and content shown to
be intact. Furthermore, users cannot interfere with each other's items stored
within the distributed hash table unless they have access to the same private
key.</p>

<p>Items are self contained and any that do not pass the cryptographic checks
are ignored and nodes on the network that attempt to propagate such values are
punished by being blocked by their peers.</p>

<p>Programming the drogulus is done via Logos, a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity">homoiconic</a> language:
this means code and data are the same thing in Logos. This has the interesting
mind-bending side effect that Logos programs can rewrite other Logos programs
in order to extend the Logos programming language itself. This is an important
property: users have the autonomy to grow the Logos programming language to
suit their own needs.</p>

<p>Since Logos programs are also data they are stored as values within the
distributed hash table so users can re-use each other's code.</p>

<p>They run in asynchronous "ensembles" on other nodes in the drogulus network.
The result is delivered when the ensemble eventually arrives at a consensus. To
protect peers, Logos programs are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)">sandboxed</a>
and intentionally limited in terms of time (how long they can run for) and
space (how much memory may be used).</p>

<p>At each point in hacking together the drogulus I've tried to build a
solution whose outcomes reflect my ethical and political considerations: a
focus on autonomy and openness and the removal of authority and choke
points.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the drogulus is unfinished! Currently, the distributed hash
table is almost done, the cryptographic layer is finished and Logos is in the
advanced planning stages with some experimental code written.</p>

<p>It's early days and I realise that there are potential contradictions and
problems that I've not worked out, nor is there anything useful that can be
achieved with the drogulus at this moment in time. Because I'm working at such
an abstract level it's hard for me to comprehend what use others may find for a
programmable peer-to-peer data store. That's why I wanted to present the
drogulus in its current incomplete state: to gauge what sort of reaction (if
any) it might get.</p>

<p>I'll finish by pointing out that in 1996
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson">William Gibson</a>
described the web as merely the
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/14/magazine/the-net-is-a-waste-of-time.html?pagewanted=all">test card for 21st century technology</a>.
I'd like to think we can do better than the web. Thinking outside its confines
has been a liberating experience and I'd encourage everyone to do the same.
Obviously the drogulus is the rough and ready result of such pondering by
me.</p>

<p>We'd only have ourselves to blame if we don't imagine and build something
better than the test card that is the web. After all, if there's one thing that
the web has taught us, it is that engineering software is a far more useful,
tangible and easier agent of change than traditional means of political
engagement.</p>

<p>The code is on <a href="http://github.com/ntoll/drogulus">GitHub</a> and
I've created a simple <a href="http://drogul.us">website</a> that explains
things further. If you have any questions please drop me an
<a href="/contact">email</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Most of the technical questions I was asked resulted
in me saying, "I don't know". I consider this a good thing. It was interesting
that someone picked up on etymological fun I've been having with this project.
;-)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> I've attempted to give considered answers to the
questions raised at Opentech in <a href="/article/drogulus-questions-and-clarifications">this blog post</a>.</p>
