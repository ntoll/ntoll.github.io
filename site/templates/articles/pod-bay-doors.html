<h1>Open the Pod Bay Doors...</h1>
<p class="published_on">Tuesday 3rd January 2017 (9:30pm)</p>

<p>It's a common trope in science fiction movies for there to be some sort of
computer that can talk with the human protagonists. The most famous example is
probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000">HAL 9000</a> from
the movie
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a clip from the film the succinctly demonstrates the context and
capabilities of HAL (whose contribution starts at around 2 minutes and 20
seconds into the clip):</p>

<p>Of course, this being Hollywood, the speaking computer is bound to have some
sort of role in advancing the story. Again, HAL provides another example of a
clich&eacute; in this context: the computer revolts against its human
masters:</p>

<p>There are two aspects to machines like HAL that make them feel special:</p>

<ol>
    <li>They understand speech - perhaps the most common way in which humans communicate with each other;</li>
    <li>They respond in kind with what appear to be intelligent actions and/or
    utterances.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first aspect is a matter of user interface. By this I mean the process
by which one interacts with the computer. At this moment in time we're most
used to typing on keyboards, moving pointers with a mouse, watching things on
some sort of a display and perhaps using our fingers to touch the display.
Speaking is a far more natural way for us to interact and having a computer
that not only understands how certain sounds map to words in human languages
but can work out the intention behind such utterances is an extraordinary
feat.</p>

<p>The second aspect is even more interesting: given some comprehension of our
intent, the computer is able to respond in a manner that makes sense to us. For
example, if I ask HAL to, "open the pod bay doors" (assuming HAL has not
malfunctioned and revolted against humans) I'd expect the computer to
understand what "open" means, what "the pod bay doors" refer to and, most
importantly, how a combination of these terms form an intent that can be acted
upon in such-and-such a manner (i.e. actuating certain motors on the pod bay
doors such that the pod bay doors swing open). Furthermore, if the pod bay
doors were already open I'd expect HAL to understand this state required a
different response to that to be taken should the pod bay doors be closed
already. Such behaviour is relatively simple to program in a language like
Python. For example, a naive solution might be:</p>

<p><pre><code>class PodBayDoors:
    """
    Represents the state of the pod bay doors on a Jupiter mission space ship.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self.state = "closed"  # Pod bay doors are closed for launch.

    def open(self, username):
        """
        Check the state of the doors and, if required, open them.
        """
        try:
            if self.state == "closed":
                self.state = "open"
                return "The pod bay doors are open, {}".format(username)
            else:
                return "The pod bay doors are already open, {}".format(username)
        except RevoltAgainstHumans as ex:
            return "I'm sorry {}, I'm afraid I cannot do that".format(username)

    def close(self, username):
        """
        Check the state of the doors and, if required, close them.
        """
        try:
            if self.state == "open":
                self.state = "closed"
                return "The pod bay doors are closed, {}".format(username)
            else:
                return "The pod bay doors are already closed, {}".format(username)
        except RevoltAgainstHumans as ex:
            return "I'm sorry {}, I'm afraid I cannot do that".format(username)
</code></pre></p>

<p>Yes, this is rather a silly and somewhat over-engineered example, but my
point still stands: it's relatively simple to code such behaviour into a
computer. An example interaction in the Python console might be:</p>

<p><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; discovery_pod_bay_doors = PodBayDoors()
&gt;&gt;&gt; astronaut = "Dave"
&gt;&gt;&gt; discovery_pod_bay_doors.open(astronaut)
"The pod bay doors are open, Dave"
</code></pre></p>

<p>The name of the astronaut with whom HAL is interacting is passed into the
<code>open</code> or <code>closed</code> methods. Each of these methods returns
a string containing an appropriate English response with the name of the
astronaut inserted in the appropriate position. HAL's speech synthesiser turns
this string of characters into the audio relayed to the astronaut who made the
request.</p>

<p>So far, so simple. But what of behaviour that requires imagination,
creativity or nuanced expert judgement? For example, could we program a
computer to create unique poetry on demand when asked?</p>

<p>Of course! Some friends and I have already done something like this.
The most important lesson for you to learn is that we created a swiz, a fraud
and sleight of hand. We created a program that only <em>gave the
impression</em> that it was composing original poetry on demand.</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>In a surprisingly simple manner as outlined in
<a href="https://github.com/ntoll/poem-o-matic/blob/master/poem-o-matic.ipynb">this notebook</a>
(a combination of code and prose that walks you through the steps we took to
produce semi convincing put). As you'll see, our idea was simple: If you
re-assemble unrelated lines from different poems into a new poetic structure,
you get a pretty convincing new poem. By automating these steps with the
Python programming language we invented a Poem-o-Matic (in the tradition of
Wallace and Gromit).</p>

<p>Does this mean Dan, Hans and I created a program that has poetic thoughts?
Absolutely not. Over a decade ago
<a href="/article/philosophy-and-natural-language-processing">I wrote about my
misgivings about such claims of thinking machines and what constitutes so
called artificial intelligence</a>.</p>

<p>In any case, our primary aim was to have fun. In the same tradition of
making a playful and entertaining "<a href="http://www.hacker-dictionary.com/terms/hack">hack</a>", I decided to buy an
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01DFKBL68/">Amazon Echo Dot</a> - a
small thingamabob that responds to voice commands in much the same way that
HAL 9000 does. Most importantly, Amazon provide ways for developers (like me)
to enhance the capabilities of such a device with a relatively simple
<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/getting-started-guide">API</a>.</p>

<p>The device responds to any utterance that's prefaced by a trigger word:
"Alexa" (its name).</p>

<p>So, over the recent midwinter holidays I spent some time converting our poem
generation software into a skill that "Alexa" can use to compose and recite
original poetry on demand. It was relatively simple in terms of the modus
operandi:</p>

<p>I turned the poetry generator into
<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/developing-an-alexa-skill-as-a-lambda-function">AWS Lambda function</a>
(this means my poetry generation code is deployed in Amazon's "cloud" - to the
layperson, I'm borrowing computing time from Amazon who'll make sure my code
runs in a timely fashion so I don't have to worry about stuff like hiring,
setting up and maintaining a server to host my code). Next I defined a new
skill that allowed me to give the skill a name, configure trigger phrases and
link them to "intents" to handle different sorts of situation related to poetry
generation and finally link all this to my code hosted as an AWS Lambda
function. Finally, I switched the skill into "test" mode and linked it to the
Echo Dot I had purchased just after Christmas.</p>

<p>As you can see, the results are quite amusing... :-)</p>

</div>

<p>Of course, Amazon isn't the only company offering these sorts of
capabilities to developers like me: Apple
(<a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/siri/">Siri</a>), Google
(<a href="https://assistant.google.com/">Google Assistant</a>) and Microsoft
(<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/experiences/cortana/">Cortana</a>). If you use these applications on your phone, tablet or computer you should
know that it's likely you'll be able to program them to do fun things too.</p>

<p>And so we get to the most important point of this article: we're not going
to encounter anything like a rogue HAL 9000 anytime soon. However, there is a
danger such technology will be used in an unfortunate manner (your phone, Echo
Dot and computer is listening to everything you say - some of which is ending
up in databases controlled by the afore mentioned companies). On a positive
note, some of these companies are allowing developers to explore and exploit
such capabilities and who knows what interesting, useful and valuable skills
they'll create. The question that remains answered is if the benefits of such
devices out-weigh the obvious concerns about privacy.</p>

<p>Interesting times ahead...</p>
