	<p>I perfomed the <a href="http://ntoll.org/article/vaughan-williams-tuba-concerto-programme-notes">Vaughan-Williams Tuba Concerto</a> this evening. It went well and the audience responded enthusiastically.</p>

	<p>I'll have to work out what to do with my evenings now I don't have to practice&#8230; hmm&#8230; how about reading my backlog of books starting with Searle's "Speech Acts", "Programming Erlang" and various Python related materials.</p>

	<p>Too much to do but so little time&#8230;</p>
