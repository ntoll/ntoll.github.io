<h1>Europython 2012</h1>
<p class="published_on">Thursday 9 August 2012 (12:00AM)</p>

<p>Europython was a month ago (early July) and I've been meaning to pull
together a write-up since. So here goes...</p>

<p>First of all, <a href="http://www.python.it/">Python Italia</a> are some
<em>seriously well organised</em> folks. I can't think of another programming
conference that was so smoothly executed. Add to that the food (yes, the FOOD!)
and location (Florence is a city everyone should take the time to visit) and
you have something akin to programmer utopia. I especially enjoyed several
UK Pythonistas and London Dojo attendees giving talks: Mike Sandford's talk on
<a href="https://ep2012.europython.eu/conference/talks/getting-the-logging-module-to-do-your-bidding">the logging module</a> was especially useful and Peter
Inglesby's "<a href="https://ep2012.europython.eu/conference/talks/discovering-descriptors">Discovering Descriptors</a>" was a fascinating dive into attribute access
(for non-geeks: yeah, I know... sounds <em>really</em> interesting right..?).</p>

<p>I gave a talk that combined my love of programming and music:</p>

<p>It seemed to go quite well and the attendees (standing room only) seemed to
enjoy it. I was secretly pleased to have
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling">rickrolled</a> them all
(in Latin!) without any of them noticing (watch the video and see if you can
spot the offending slide). I was also delighted that many of the attendees
couldn't tell the difference between my computer generated music and that
composed by Mozart or Fux. In any case, all the code and the HTML/CSS for the
slides can be found <a href="https://github.com/ntoll/foox">on github</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, the best part of Europython was being able to attend with Mary
(but without our three children who were staying with grandparents). Not only
did we have a lot of of fun discovering Florence together but we were out
every evening enjoying the tastes, sights and sounds of that great city with
friends old and new. It was also fun for me because it gave Mary a
window into my (often quite abstract and inaccessible) world and see me give
my talk. Given that Europython 2013 will be in Florence again I suspect we'll
both be back next year.</p>

<p>What's next? Well, <a href="http://pyconuk.org">PyconUK</a> is just around
the corner and there's another <a href="http://nhshackday.com">NHSHackday</a>
soon! If you're going, say hi!</p>
