&lt;p&gt;I have a new tuba!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my mention of a tuba is a surprise (it
&lt;a href=&quot;/article/remembering-john&quot;&gt;shouldn&#x27;t&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;/article/vaughan-williams-tuba-concerto-programme-notes&quot;&gt;be&lt;/a&gt;),
check out this short student-film, by my buddy
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cluttercup&quot;&gt;Jane&lt;/a&gt;, which explains all:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;video-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YlS9lpybYxo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new tuba isn&#x27;t a replacement for my current instrument (which I got when
I was sixteen years old). Rather, the instruments complement each other. What&#x27;s
the difference? If my current tuba is a professional &quot;all rounder&quot;, my new
instrument is a sort of &quot;heavy duty&quot; tuba for big orchestral pieces (most of my
current playing is orchestral).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tuba works by amplifying the buzzing sound I make with my lips
into a mouthpiece. I change notes by tensing or relaxing my lips (so the
buzzing sound gets higher or lower) which gives me a limited series of notes
that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtone&quot;&gt;overtones&lt;/a&gt; to the
&quot;fundamental&quot; (lowest) note produced by blowing down the length of the tube of
the instrument. I use valves to add tubing to the length of the instrument to
fill in the notes between the overtones so I can play all the notes I need
(i.e. a chromatic scale).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&#x27;s interesting is how the two instruments are different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My original instrument is pitched in Eb (E flat) -- which means the
instrument&#x27;s fundamental note is the Eb more than an octave below the bass
clef (i.e. very low). My new instrument is pitched in C, so its fundamental
note is &lt;em&gt;even lower&lt;/em&gt;, thus making it an instrument more suited to lower
sounding music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The valves on each instrument are different. I have &quot;piston&quot; valves on my
original instrument. These are spring loaded and when pressed fully down add
additional lengths of tubing to the instrument. The photograph below is of the
inside of the valve so you can see the holes in the piston used to connect 
the different pipes, depending on the valve&#x27;s position (up or down).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/piston_valve.jpg&quot;
    alt=&quot;The inside of a piston valve.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new instrument uses &quot;rotary&quot; valves. These, as the diagram below shows,
rotate to connect additional lengths of tubing (the passage of air is indicated
by the hatched area). A sort of lever is used to actuate each valve. They&#x27;re
generally much quieter and more reliable than piston valves (less moving parts
to make clanking sounds) although they can be slower to &quot;engage&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/rotary_valve.jpg&quot;
    alt=&quot;A diagramatic view of a rotary valve.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture below shows the rotary valves on my new tuba. Notice the
levers I press with my fingers to engage the valves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/rotary_valves.jpg&quot;
    alt=&quot;Rotary valves on my new tuba.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While both tubas look &quot;tuba shaped&quot; my original tuba points to the right
(as the player is looking at the instrument) whereas my new instrument points
to the left. This simply means I have to hold them differently and there&#x27;s not
really any change in sound. You can see this difference in the picture
below (the new tuba is on the right):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/two_tubas.jpg&quot;
    alt=&quot;My two tubas.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final major difference is in the number of valves each instrument has.
My original instrument has four &quot;compensating&quot; valves which allow me to get a
full chromatic scale. The new instrument has five &quot;non-compensating&quot; valves:
the first four work like my original instrument and allow me to play a full
chromatic scale, but the fifth valve is used to help tune the very lowest
notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does the new tuba need a special extra &quot;tuning&quot; valve and what on earth
am I talking about when I say &quot;compensating&quot;..? This, dear reader, is where
maths, acoustics, logic and music come together in a spectacular fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new tuba is approximately 524.9 cm in length without any valves engaged.
This produces the note, &quot;C&quot;. The first valve adds enough pipe to lower the
pitch by a tone, giving me a &quot;Bb&quot; (B flat) which requires the total length of
tube to be 589.2 cm. Simple arithmetic tells us the total length of the tube
added by using the first valve is therefore 64.3 cm (the &quot;open&quot; length of the
instrument with the added tube should give the correct length to play a tone
lower). The second valve drops the pitch by a semitone to the note &quot;B&quot; which
requires a total length of 556.1 cm. Similarly, the third valve lowers the
pitch by one and a half tones, giving me an &quot;A&quot; which requires the total length
of tube to be 624.2 cm. Again, the simple arithmetic tells me that the length
of tube added by the second valve is 31.2 cm while the length added by the
third valve is 99.3 cm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s where it gets interesting. If I want to play the note &quot;G&quot; I need to
make the length of the instrument 700.6 cm. Given the note &quot;G&quot; is two and a
half tones below &quot;C&quot; I could take the tone provided by the first valve and
one and a half tones of the third valve and use them together. It means the
resulting length of additional pipe is 64.3 cm (the first valve) + 99.3 cm 
(the third valve) giving me a total of 163.6 cm. However, the open length of
the instrument (524.9 cm) with the additional lengths of pipe (163.6) brings
the total length to 688.5 cm, which isn&#x27;t the 700.6 cm needed to play the
note in tune!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution is to use my fourth valve, which adds 175.7 cm to the length
of the instrument, thus making it in tune. However, when I need to use my
fourth valve in combination with my other three valves I still encounter the
same sort of &quot;wrong length of pipe&quot; problem I describe above. I &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt;
use combinations of valves in order to get all the notes I need in the
chromatic scale. So what can I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the fifth valve on my new tuba comes into play. It has a
special tuning slide I can adjust &quot;in real time&quot; as I play, thus allowing me
to tune the fifth valve as and when I need it. It can also be tuned in such a
way that it &quot;compensates&quot; (remember that word) for the missing lengths of
tubing when I use the other valves together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which leaves us with the problem of keeping my current tuba (with only four
valves) in tune. Thankfully, this instrument has &quot;compensating&quot; valves which
work in a rather ingenious manner. The schematic representation of my current
tuba is shown below. The mouthpiece is on the left with the bell on the right
and between are the four valves and associated tubing (not to scale). None of
the valves are engaged so the column of air blown through the instrument goes
directly through without any &quot;detours&quot; (as shown by the pipe filled in with
blue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/compensating_open.png&quot;
    alt=&quot;Compensating system, no valves pressed.&quot;/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I press the first and third valves down the expected two extra lengths
of tubing are added, as shown by the two loops of pipe filled with blue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/compensating_13.png&quot;
    alt=&quot;Compensating system, valves 1 and 3 pressed.&quot;/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s where it gets really clever. When the fourth valve is pressed down,
not only is the expected additional length of tube added to the length of the
instrument, but this tube is also diverted back through the other three valves
which have additional &quot;compensating&quot; tubes to bring the instrument in tune:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/compensating_134.png&quot;
    alt=&quot;Compensating system, valves 1, 3 and 4 pressed.&quot;/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, essentially, a logical &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt; expressed as pipe-work. If
the first and fourth valves are pressed then add some new &quot;compensating&quot; length
of pipe. Clever huh..?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disadvantage of this system is the air does two &quot;circuits&quot; around the
instrument (once through the first three valves, and then again if the fourth
valve is pressed so the compensating pipes can come into effect). This makes
the instrument harder to blow (since there are more bends to blow through).
My new instrument feels like there is less to push against when I&#x27;m
playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, given all the technical tuba-related geekery described above I want
to end on an artistic note...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These instruments are beautiful to look at and playing them is a joy. It&#x27;s
hard to explain to folks who have never performed music what an amazing
privilege it is. I get to play beautifully designed and precision engineered
instruments as part of an orchestra, band or smaller ensemble. By playing with
my fellow musicians to an audience I&#x27;m taking part in a unique social activity.
No matter the mood or difficulty of the piece I&#x27;m playing, I love the sense of
non-verbal communication I have with my fellow musicians and collectively with
the audience. I love that I am a part of something creative, challenging,
expressive, collaborative and most definitely greater than the sum of its
parts. That the audience appreciate these efforts is a lovely positive
side effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, this is always &quot;joyful noise&quot;. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>CodeGrades</title>

        <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ntoll.org/article/codegrades&quot;&gt;CodeGrades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;published_on&quot;&gt;Saturday, 5th January 2019 (3:30PM)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people want to learn how to program computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of code &quot;boot camps&quot; and devices aimed at the education sector
(Raspberry Pi and the BBC&#x27;s micro:bit spring to mind) is evidence of this
desire for folks to learn &quot;coding&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when technology is finding its way into every aspect of our lives
many folks appear to want to be more than just passive consumers of technology.
They feel a desire to become creators of technology. They want to take control
of their digital world. They want the skills to make their technology reflect
their own needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I&#x27;ve been experimenting with how I could use my background and
expertise in music education in a way that helps folks address this desire for
learning to program. The first experiment took place over the autumn and
involved a group of complete beginners preparing for a &quot;code grade&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://codegrades.com/&quot;&gt;CodeGrades&lt;/a&gt; are a programming version
of time-proven techniques like music grades, belts in martial arts or lifeguard
certification. Learners level up by applying the knowledge and skills needed
for each grade to their own fun, interesting and challenging coding projects.
Learners present their projects to professional software developers who
assess the projects against the criteria for the grade being taken and provide
a set of marks and written feedback so the learner can see where they&#x27;re doing
well, what needs to improve and what their next steps may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The autumnal experiment proved this concept worked. The initial group of
learners were able to learn enough to create a &quot;grade 1&quot; level project in the
Python programming language in about ten weeks. Furthermore, after completing
their grading the vast majority asked when they can take their next grade.
This outcome was far better than I had ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like music grades, code grades are eight cumulative steps for learning how
to write code. The first grade (as taken by our &quot;test subjects&quot;) is easy
enough for most people to take as a first step into programming. The eighth
grade is of equivalent standard to the skills and knowledge needed to be an
effective junior professional software developer. The middle grades bridge
the way so the skill gaps between each of the grades is
achievable. They&#x27;re like stepping stones into coding, or perhaps a modern
day &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradus_ad_Parnassum&quot;&gt;Gradus ad
Parnassum&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important aspect of CodeGrades is how it is different to
other educational offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code boot-camps will charge you north of £10k for a three month course and
a guaranteed &quot;job&quot; as a junior developer. This is, frankly, a terrible idea.
Not only are people throwing huge sums of money over a cliff edge before they
make the jump themselves, but learning to code requires a long term investment
of time. You cannot learn how to write effective code in just three months.
What the boot-camps have realised is that you can learn enough
&lt;em&gt;information&lt;/em&gt; in just three months to appear as if you can code. It has
been my unhappy experience to interview graduates of such schemes and have them
answer my questions about the niceties of some aspect of coding with text-book
answers; yet most have been unable to apply such &quot;text book answers&quot; in any
useful or even credible way. Those who did create something made what can
only be described as &quot;spaghetti code&quot;. This is the equivalent of claiming that
it&#x27;s possible to train musicians to a professional level in just three months.
Can you imagine how an orchestra would sound with musicians trained in this
way? Would you want to hire such musicians to play for your wedding party?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other educational efforts are mostly aimed at beginner developers. As a
result, all their educational resources are at the beginner end of the scale
and there is hardly any guidance for how to move onto more challenging
programming. Put another way, it&#x27;s like getting a piano with lots of beginner
level music to learn, but nothing which will stretch you after you&#x27;ve got the
basics in place. There is simply no continuity nor access to the fun
&quot;advanced&quot; stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The syllabus for CodeGrades is written by professional software developers.
The grades reflect current best practice found in the software industry. They
offer a framework for sustained and structured long term learning to write
code. All the resources associated with CodeGrades are free, learners only pay
to take the grading. CodeGrades will be priced in a way equivalent to music and
ballet grades or martial arts belts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CodeGrades help you learn to code with the confidence you need to make
the stuff you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upshot is that it&#x27;s the start of the year, and I&#x27;ve decided that the
outcomes from the experiment in the autumn have been so positive that I want to
invest some of my own time into developing the concept further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here&#x27;s to an interesting
2019... I hope to work with friends (old and new) in making something that
helps people learn and grow while also providing employment for developers
who feel they&#x27;re at a stage in their career where they want to acquire and
practice the skills needed to be effective and inspiring mentors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy new year.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Compassion.py</title>
        <link>http://ntoll.org/article/compassion</link>
        <guid>http://ntoll.org/article/compassion</guid>
        <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ntoll.org/article/compassion&quot;&gt;Compassion.py&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;published_on&quot;&gt;Monday, 22nd October 2018 (1:00PM)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I write from a place of love and respect for the UK Python programming community.
Some of what follows may make painful reading (sorry). But I want to be clear:
if you misconstrue my words as aggressive, nasty or hurtful, then you have
completely misunderstood my intent. I will never knowingly be a source of
vindictive pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m going to shine a light on the (usually hidden) problems I have encountered
in the UK Python community over the ten years that I&#x27;ve been volunteering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s hard to do this without appearing as if mud slinging or trying to diminish
the considerable public-facing achievements of the UK Python community in doing
genuinely wonderful things. I am anxious to avoid a situation that undermines
all the good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But only by highlighting and acknowledging such hidden problems can action be
taken to address them. I hope you bear with me as I try to find the words to
explain things in a constructive, non-confrontational yet honest way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems of which I speak are many in number and range from the
institutional (a woman of limited means put into the humiliating position of
having to beg for financial support), and petty (describing the John Pinner
awards as &quot;just a popularity contest&quot;) to plagiarism (members of
the community claiming the work and intellectual property of others as their
own) and an exercise of power and control for organisational gain (a sponsor
taking steps to exclude others from fully participating in a community event
-- they threatened to pull out if they didn&#x27;t get their way). Sadly, I have a
list as long as my arm full of such things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above and beyond these problems are personal attacks, slights and snark aimed
directly at me (more on this later). Having said that, I want you to know that
I bear no ill-will nor grudges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m necessarily vague about the details: I don&#x27;t believe finger pointing or
blame is a useful or constructive way forward. Far better to honestly and
constructively highlight such problems in the hope that they are acknowledged
and can be avoided in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking, &quot;that&#x27;s not the UK Python community I know&quot;, then I am
happy for you. You know the joyous, supportive and friendly place that
welcomed and sustained me as a new Python programmer in 2007. I wish you good
fortune and hope you cherish, advance and grow this aspect of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, such problems are themselves problematic because they are so often
hidden. Furthermore, I&#x27;ve observed that those involved often don&#x27;t appear to realise they are
causing a problem. Upon reflection, I believe such situations are caused by a
lack of just one thing: compassion (an awareness of and sympathy for another&#x27;s
feelings and suffering, mixed with a pro-active desire to help).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my plea to members of the UK Python community is to show more compassion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you remain unconvinced of my plea, I want to explain what happens when we
lack compassion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past three years I have grown despondent about the problems I have
encountered in the UK&#x27;s Python community. This past year the
feeling became unbearable, to the extent that I sought professional help to
deal with mental health problems solely arising from my contact with the UK
Python community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend a straw broke the camel&#x27;s back and, after a considerable amount of
thought and reflection, I finally decided to publicly reveal how I felt 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ntoll/status/1051134675064897538&quot;&gt;via&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ntoll/status/1051195641727242241&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.
I&#x27;d been sitting on a huge amount of pent up frustration and sadness,
and there needed to be a controlled release. I came to the realisation that
only by &quot;coming clean&quot; and honestly describing my feelings would I be able to
heal, move on and allow my life to return to some normality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say the reaction has been &quot;interesting&quot; is an understatement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;d like to start by thanking the many people who took the time to reach out
with kind messages of support. You are the best of us, and the reason why the
UK Python community is often an amazing place. Your compassion and
thoughtfulness is an example to us all. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I was reduced to tears of hurt by the initial reaction of one member
of our community who went for the jugular (and it saddens me deeply that this
reaction was &quot;liked&quot; by a number of other people in the UK Python community).
I have been asked to justify my feelings to others (how dare I feel this way
about the UK Python community) and I have had my words picked over in public
leading to unwanted, unhelpful and upsetting comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These latter reactions inadvertently demonstrate why I&#x27;ve been feeling
despondent. They show a complete lack of compassion and suppress hoped-for
constructive dialogue or catharsis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My despondency and poor mental health is directly linked to encountering and
dealing with an excessive number of such problems: a sort of death by a
thousand paper cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;But why didn&#x27;t you reach out for help?&quot; you may ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was rebuffed when I tried to find support from several individuals in the UK
Python community. This led me to a downward spiral of frustration, self doubt
and sadness: &quot;What have I done to deserve this? Am I such an obnoxious person
that people would refrain from showing support? Why am I not able to speak of
my pain?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt a complete failure, rejected and disempowered by the whole situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only choice has been to step away from the UK Python community. It&#x27;s not the
ending I would have wanted and it makes me feel extraordinarily sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my tweets brought acknowledgement from others in the international Python
community. I&#x27;m not on my own in encountering such problems or the associated
feelings of despondency. This is definitely not only a UK Python issue.
My far flung friends highlighted patterns, features and common ground which,
in turn, helped me realise, &quot;I am not the only one&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, by speaking of these things I feel I have turned a corner and have
felt a great sense of release, although I still carry a huge amount of sadness
and pain about how things turned out. For what it&#x27;s worth, I hope people in the
UK Python community never treat one of their own like this ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will I do next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, this boils down to a positive assertion, through deeds and words, of
humanity, honesty, compassion, patience, love and respect. What that entails
depends on all sorts of complicated variables: who, what, where, when and how
a situation is. Ironically for a conversation about a programming community,
it&#x27;s not a case of following an algorithm -- I&#x27;ll have to exercise that
unique and precious spark which means I&#x27;m not an unfeeling machine: my
humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
