        <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ntoll.org/article/20-years&quot;&gt;20 Years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;published_on&quot;&gt;Wednesday 2nd August 2017 (9:00am)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is our 20th wedding anniversary. Such an auspicious occasion deserves
celebrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/wedding.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Our wedding day.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary and I face the world together: we laugh with (and at) each other, we
trust each other and we rely on each other. It is a great source of strength
and comfort that the person I love most in the world thinks of me as the person
they love most in the world. It&#x27;s a virtuous circle of mutual love, support,
friendship and affection. Since this is something only Mary and I share with
each other, it makes it all the more precious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet we find ourselves in a wonderful situation. Our bonds strengthen over
time as our shared experience grows, for example, as parents bringing up our
three children to be confident, independent and flourishing individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did this begin?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first met Mary in the Donaldson Room in the library of the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://rcm.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;Royal College of Music&lt;/a&gt;. By chance, we were sat
at the same table. I was with a buddy and she was with her friend, Ellen. They
were playing &quot;hangman&quot; and instead of calling out the vowels to get the shape
of the word to be guessed, Mary would say things like &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Q&quot; or &quot;W&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;You have absolutely no idea how to play hangman, do you?&quot;, I
interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh yes I do... I&#x27;m just playing it this way for fun.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three hours later our friends had left us as we talked the afternoon away
discussing science, philosophy and music. At the end Mary said, &quot;I&#x27;m very
sorry, but I&#x27;m late for a rehearsal. I&#x27;d much rather talk to you... what&#x27;s your
name?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;d never met anyone like her. That was it. In that moment. She was the
one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were very fortunate to meet and marry at a young age. Consequently, it&#x27;s
likely that we have 40 years or more of marriage ahead of us. That&#x27;s 40 more
years of making memories, having fun and growing old with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here&#x27;s to facing the future together and long may it last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(In case you were wondering, we&#x27;ve agreed to hold a big party for all our
friends and family on the occasion of our 25th anniversary: 2nd August,
2022.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mu</title>
        <link>http://ntoll.org/article/mu-pi</link>
        <guid>http://ntoll.org/article/mu-pi</guid>
        <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ntoll.org/article/mu-pi&quot;&gt;Mu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;published_on&quot;&gt;Wednesday 3rd May 2017 (5:30pm)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mu (&lt;a href=&quot;https://codewith.mu/&quot;&gt;codewith.mu&lt;/a&gt;) is a simple code editor
for beginner programmers. In case you&#x27;re wondering, you pronounce it like
&quot;moo&quot;, and it is named after the Greek character &quot;&amp;mu;&quot;, used to represent
micro units of measurement in the decimal system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote the first version in December 2015 as a Sunday-afternoon &quot;hack&quot;. At
the time I was volunteering effort for the BBC&#x27;s
&lt;a href=&quot;http://microbit.org/&quot;&gt;micro:bit&lt;/a&gt; project - a computing device for
kids that encourages them to learn how to code. I had already written a browser
based editor for the project but, unfortunately, when I tested it on teachers,
kids and developers it soon became apparent that it wasn&#x27;t a great experience.
While the convenience of a browser-based editor was initially welcomed, the
faffing about caused by the browser-imposed limitations of the editor meant it
wasn&#x27;t a pleasant experience in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problematic situation motivated me to put together the simplest yet
most useful editor I could imagine. I wrote it so beginner programmers could 
easily write MicroPython code for the micro:bit. Et voil&amp;agrave;, Mu was
born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quickly formulated a &quot;Mu philosophy&quot; to help guide my development
process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Less is More&lt;/em&gt;: Mu has only the most essential
    features, so users are not intimidated by a baffling interface.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep it Simple&lt;/em&gt;: It&#x27;s quick and easy to learn Mu -
    complexity impedes a novice programmer&#x27;s first steps.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Path of Least Resistance&lt;/em&gt;: Whatever the task, there is
    always only one obvious way to do it with Mu.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have Fun&lt;/em&gt;: Learning should inspire fun - Mu helps
    learners quickly create and test working code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had three goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;An editor that clearly demonstrated the design philosophy outlined
    above.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;An editor with a simple enough code base that an enthusiastic teenager
    could learn from and contribute to the project.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;An editor that was well tested so we could be confident in the quality
    and stability of its code, while giving us the confidence to make changes
    as the project moved forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I used a wish-list enumerated by my buddy
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MissPhilbin&quot;&gt;Carrie Anne&lt;/a&gt; (who is the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/&quot;&gt;Rasperry Pi&lt;/a&gt;&#x27;s Director of
Education) as my feature guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raspberry Pi is &lt;strong&gt;the most successful computing-in-education
project in history&lt;/strong&gt; if you measure number of devices shipped. This
success means Carrie Anne has had feedback from a huge number of teachers and,
most importantly, beginner programmers concerning what it feels like to take
those first steps in learning to write code. This feedback informed
her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gU7sfTrz4c&quot;&gt;keynote
address&lt;/a&gt; to 2015&#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://europython.eu/&quot;&gt;EuroPython
conference&lt;/a&gt; where she listed the sorts of things needed for a beginner&#x27;s
code editor. This, in turn, inspired me in terms of prioritising and
implementing features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then something funny happened. My goofy editor became popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that lots of people love learning with Mu. Its simplicity is
often described as a key factor. The wider Python community have also taken
an interest with many fellow Pythonists contributing improvements. It has taken
on a life of its own with a friendly community of contributors and
users. This makes me very happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most requested improvement from our users is that Mu become a &quot;general&quot;
editor rather than just targeting the micro:bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m delighted to say this will happen very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the support of the Raspberry Pi Foundation I&#x27;ll be spending the
next three months transitioning Mu into a &quot;generic&quot; beginner&#x27;s editor. I&#x27;ll be
working closely with Carrie Anne and her colleagues to learn how best to help
beginner programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mu will still work with the micro:bit, but it will also work with other
boards too (such as those from the awesome people at
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adafruit.com/&quot;&gt;Adafruit&lt;/a&gt; and MicroPython&#x27;s original
&lt;a href=&quot;https://micropython.org/&quot;&gt;PyBoard&lt;/a&gt;). Of course, it will act as an
editor for &quot;regular&quot; Python code running on your Raspberry Pi, laptop or PC.
I&#x27;ve even created a very simple visual debugger to help you watch and inspect
your code as it runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very exciting and I&#x27;ll post regular updates since we aim to follow
the mantra, &quot;release early, release often&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, we want &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; to be involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try out a new version when we release it. Tell us about bugs. Can you think
of a way to improve Mu? What&#x27;s the most useful thing you&#x27;d love Mu to do? Tell
us about the niggles and gremlins you wish could be ironed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, Mu belongs to its community and we&#x27;d love you to join us to take
part in shaping its future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Liberation Technology</title>
        <link>http://ntoll.org/article/liberation-technology</link>
        <guid>http://ntoll.org/article/liberation-technology</guid>
        <description>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ntoll.org/article/liberation-technology&quot;&gt;Liberation Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;published_on&quot;&gt;Monday 16th January 2017 (3:00pm)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Some raw thoughts for you. I welcome feedback and engagement via
email.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two considerations are core to my work on technical projects: ethics and
politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t mean ethics in the sense of a professional code of conduct nor do I
mean politics in the sense of what goes on in Parliament. I use these terms in
a philosophical way. For instance, from an ethical point of view, I&#x27;m concerned
with how I live and behave, how I may be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; and how I&#x27;m able to
coherently reason about such concepts. In a political sense I wonder how
diverse groups of people live and work together, how collective decision making
takes place and the nature of power ~ how it is obtained, exercised and
controlled.  I reflect upon my life as an individual and my place in our
society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this important?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an atheist: I don&#x27;t believe in an afterlife. Nevertheless, I am alive,
and as far as I can tell it&#x27;s only going to happen once, so I&#x27;m going to make
the best of it. Asking &quot;how?&quot; leads to ethics and politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What have ethics and politics to do with technology?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I must be clear that by &quot;technology&quot;, for the purposes of this post,
I mean computing - machines programmed with instructions to some (hopefully)
useful end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, such instructions (software) do not distinguish morality or
legality - they are merely capability. Capability permits certain forms of
computer based behaviour that in turn pose ethical and political questions,
requirements and possibilities for both users and programmers (like me). It&#x27;s
not the computer in and of itself that is ethical or political. Rather, it&#x27;s
the design and use of the computer &lt;em&gt;by/for/on people&lt;/em&gt; that makes it
ethical or political.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, when we write code we&#x27;re engineering a digital world from a certain
point of view that is reflected in the capabilities of the code we create.
We choose what and how such capabilities are created. Often code exercises
power over its users. For instance, your bank&#x27;s website mandates only you to
access your accounts. This is a desirable use of power. But remember, you have
no control over the machinations of the bank&#x27;s software - it is exercising
power over you and was written by someone aligned with your bank&#x27;s point of
view. Most of the technology you own or use is not under your control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is for these reasons (that people choose what to make computers do, and
often computers have power over us) that writing software is both an ethical
and political activity. Furthermore, technology is important because of its
ubiquity in most aspects of our lives (and it&#x27;s insinuating itself into those
aspects it isn&#x27;t already a part of). As
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen&quot;&gt;Marc Andreessen&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460&quot;&gt;quipped&lt;/a&gt;,
&quot;software is eating the world&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there is a problem: the vast majority of humanity are merely
consumers of technology. We consume in complete ignorance about how it works.
There are two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For most consumer technology, we don&#x27;t have the freedom to examine, reuse
  or change the software that defines the capabilities of our computing
  devices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even if we had the afore mentioned freedom, the skills, attitudes and
  knowledge required to understand, create and control technology are
  uncommon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closed and opaque nature of consumer technology has an antidote: free
software as championed by organisations such as the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://fsf.org/&quot;&gt;Free Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. Their website
explains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; Free software developers guarantee everyone equal rights to their
programs; any user can study the source code, modify it, and share the program.
By contrast, most software carries fine print that denies users these basic
rights, leaving them susceptible to the whims of its owners and vulnerable to
surveillance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people in the technology world know about the free software movement
and its achievements. Unfortunately, the second problem - a lack of skills and
knowledge - means such achievements are &lt;em&gt;only appreciated by and available
to people in the technology world who have had the privilege of access to a
technical education&lt;/em&gt;. This latter problem has been, for many years, largely
ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is to be expected: we&#x27;ve only been programming computers since the
Second World War (for example, the British Colossus and German Z3) and our
current notion of programming only emerged in the 1960s. Put simply, humanity
have not been doing this for very long when compared to other endeavours such
as writing or composing music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#x27;re only just getting started and so, proportionally, not many people know
or care about programming. People who write code have a similar place in
society as scribes in ancient Egypt - only they understand how such a valuable
and powerful thing works. It&#x27;s not that programming is hard, it is simply not
a widely practised skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we don&#x27;t have scribes: most people are literate and literacy is a
core aim of educational systems - not because everyone will become a writer or
enjoy reading, but because it&#x27;s such a fundamental skill to flourish in today&#x27;s
society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if everyone had access to source code &lt;em&gt;and had the skills to make
the software their own&lt;/em&gt;. Imagine groups currently disenfranchised by
technology making the digital world their own. Imagine a ubiquity of skill
such that doctors, musicians, lawyers, teachers, poets, architects, scientists,
politicians and others involved in a diversity of endeavours are
&lt;strong&gt;liberated by technology to advance their disciplines&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I imagine. This is why technical education is so important.
This is why I volunteer my time to promote such educational endeavours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also imagine other things: conflict, dubious use of technology, the
exploitation of others through technical means and technology as a tool for
domination, bullying and violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we return to ethics and politics. These disciplines give us the concepts,
history and vocabulary to think about our own and wider society&#x27;s use of
technology. It&#x27;s also why I believe all technical education should include
ethics and politics. The very best programmers I know understand the
importance of ethics and politics as applied to what they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever wonder why I&#x27;m motivated to work on certain projects, you&#x27;ll
probably find the answer involves much of the above. I want others to have 
the privilege of programming computers whilst also developing the ethical and
moral outlook to help them best apply their skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you agree, get involved with computing education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s a long term project and we won&#x27;t see the fruits of such labours for
another decade or more. Nevertheless, getting involved today means you help
shape how things unfold. Remember, while the skill of writing code is neutral
the intentions behind such code depend upon transmitting an ethical and
political appreciation of our world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, education makes our future possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What that future is depends upon who turns up to provide such education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&#x27;t just sit there, do something!&lt;/p&gt;
