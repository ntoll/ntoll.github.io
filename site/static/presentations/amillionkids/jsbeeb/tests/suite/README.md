TestSuite
---------

This code is under a public domain license. It was downloaded from http://modelb.bbcmicro.com/testsuite-2.15.tar.gz and used with information from http://www.softwolves.com/arkiv/cbm-hackers/7/7114.html (saved here too as `cbm-hackers-post.html`)

The original tar has been unpacked here, minus its top level directory, the `petsci-src` and some template files.

I've not put any effort into being able to rebuild the source, but I've left the source here for posterity and reference.

Please note the first file run is `" start"` - that is, it has a leading space, presumably to keep it at the top of the directory listing when iterating through the files.
