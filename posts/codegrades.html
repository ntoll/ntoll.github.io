description: Helping folks to learn to program

<p>Lots of people want to learn how to program computers.</p>

<p>The success of code "boot camps" and devices aimed at the education sector
(Raspberry Pi and the BBC's micro:bit spring to mind) is evidence of this
desire for folks to learn "coding".</p>

<p>At a time when technology is finding its way into every aspect of our lives
many folks appear to want to be more than just passive consumers of technology.
They feel a desire to become creators of technology. They want to take control
of their digital world. They want the skills to make their technology reflect
their own needs.</p>

<p>Recently I've been experimenting with how I could use my background and
expertise in music education in a way that helps folks address this desire for
learning to program. The first experiment took place over the autumn and
involved a group of complete beginners preparing for a "code grade".</p>

<p><a href="https://codegrades.com/">CodeGrades</a> are a programming version
of time-proven techniques like music grades, belts in martial arts or lifeguard
certification. Learners level up by applying the knowledge and skills needed
for each grade to their own fun, interesting and challenging coding projects.
Learners present their projects to professional software developers who
assess the projects against the criteria for the grade being taken and provide
a set of marks and written feedback so the learner can see where they're doing
well, what needs to improve and what their next steps may be.</p>

<p>The autumnal experiment proved this concept worked. The initial group of
learners were able to learn enough to create a "grade 1" level project in the
Python programming language in about ten weeks. Furthermore, after completing
their grading the vast majority asked when they can take their next grade.
This outcome was far better than I had ever imagined.</p>

<p>Like music grades, code grades are eight cumulative steps for learning how
to write code. The first grade (as taken by our "test subjects") is easy
enough for most people to take as a first step into programming. The eighth
grade is of equivalent standard to the skills and knowledge needed to be an
effective junior professional software developer. The middle grades bridge
the way so the skill gaps between each of the grades is
achievable. They're like stepping stones into coding, or perhaps a modern
day "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradus_ad_Parnassum">Gradus ad
Parnassum</a>". ;-)</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important aspect of CodeGrades is how it is different to
other educational offerings.</p>

<p>Code boot-camps will charge you north of Â£10k for a three month course and
a guaranteed "job" as a junior developer. This is, frankly, a terrible idea.
Not only are people throwing huge sums of money over a cliff edge before they
make the jump themselves, but learning to code requires a long term investment
of time. You cannot learn how to write effective code in just three months.
What the boot-camps have realised is that you can learn enough
<em>information</em> in just three months to appear as if you can code. It has
been my unhappy experience to interview graduates of such schemes and have them
answer my questions about the niceties of some aspect of coding with text-book
answers; yet most have been unable to apply such "text book answers" in any
useful or even credible way. Those who did create something made what can
only be described as "spaghetti code". This is the equivalent of claiming that
it's possible to train musicians to a professional level in just three months.
Can you imagine how an orchestra would sound with musicians trained in this
way? Would you want to hire such musicians to play for your wedding party?</p>

<p>Other educational efforts are mostly aimed at beginner developers. As a
result, all their educational resources are at the beginner end of the scale
and there is hardly any guidance for how to move onto more challenging
programming. Put another way, it's like getting a piano with lots of beginner
level music to learn, but nothing which will stretch you after you've got the
basics in place. There is simply no continuity nor access to the fun
"advanced" stuff.</p>

<p>The syllabus for CodeGrades is written by professional software developers.
The grades reflect current best practice found in the software industry. They
offer a framework for sustained and structured long term learning to write
code. All the resources associated with CodeGrades are free, learners only pay
to take the grading. CodeGrades will be priced in a way equivalent to music and
ballet grades or martial arts belts.</p>

<p>CodeGrades help you learn to code with the confidence you need to make
the stuff you want.</p>

<p>The upshot is that it's the start of the year, and I've decided that the
outcomes from the experiment in the autumn have been so positive that I want to
invest some of my own time into developing the concept further.</p>

<p>So, here's to an interesting
2019... I hope to work with friends (old and new) in making something that
helps people learn and grow while also providing employment for developers
who feel they're at a stage in their career where they want to acquire and
practice the skills needed to be effective and inspiring mentors.</p>

<p>Happy new year.</p>
