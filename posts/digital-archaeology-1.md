The first programming language I learned was
[Sophie Wilson's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Wilson)
[BBC Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_BASIC), written for Acorn's
[BBC Micro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro). Without this formative
experience, I wouldn't have become a professional software engineer.

Of course, I heard many wonderful talks, enjoyed the conversations with many
friends old and new in the famous corridor track and took part in some really
stimulating workshops (with my amazing daughter, who was attending her first
PyCon as a proper attendee with an interest in data science - she especially
enjoyed both
[Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/en/dublin/) and
[Humble Data](https://ep2022.europython.eu/humble-data)).

I love EuroPython's culturally cosmopolitan feeling, something that's hard to
recreate at a national PyCon. I love how folks keep coming back to EuroPython,
there are people who mean a lot to me, who I only ever see at this conference.
I also love EuroPython's peripatetic nature, as a community we are welcomed to
all sorts of fun places and have an opportunity to soak up the vibe of
different countries and cultures.

Long may it last, and I hope to see you at next year's EuroPython.
