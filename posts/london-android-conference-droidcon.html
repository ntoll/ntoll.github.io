	<p><img src="/static/images/90.gif" align="left" title="DroidCon" alt="DroidCon" style="padding-right: 8px;" />On Tuesday and Wednesday of this week I attended <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/os-mobile-server/droidcon-london-2009">droidcon</a>, the <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a> developer's conference organised by the friendly folks at <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/">Skills Matter</a> and Kevin and Carl from <a href="http://www.novoda.com/">Novoda</a> &#8211; the most enthusiastic mobile software development company on the planet.</p>

	<p>Tuesday was a <a href="http://barcamp.org/">barcamp</a> and a great opportunity to meet people and learn from others. I especially enjoyed Carl's talk on <a href="http://github.com/novoda/RESTProvider">his work</a> using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">RESTful</a> APIs from Android (something I've been experiment with in conjunction with <a href="http://fluidinfo.com">FluidDB</a>). Other highlights of the day included learning about the <a href="http://www.zii.com/Developer/Landing.aspx">Zii Egg and recently announced Trinity device</a>, seeing the worlds longest nested if/else statement (don't ask &#8211; very diagonal) and some really great chats both technical and "blue sky" about the potential for mobile (and specifically Android) devices.</p>

	<p>The second day was a more traditional <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/os-mobile-server/droidcon-london-2009">presentation-based conference</a> and we had some great talks. Highlights for me were a couple of presentations that delved into and demonstrated the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/1.6_r1/index.html">NDK</a> (native development kit), both of which were musical in nature (spot on for me) and had me dusting off my C/C++ books when I got home. I was also amazed by what <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/os-mobile-server/understanding-android-bytecode-with-the-dedexer-tool">Gabor Paller</a> had managed to achieve with his Dedexer tool for Dalvic byte-code disassembly. The "park-bench" and Yan Minagawa's talk about the future of mobile were particularly entertaining for the group discussion that ensued, and I'd never heard of the <a href="http://c-base.org/">c-base</a> space station that had crashed into the heart of Berlin &#8211; it sounds an awesome place. Finally, <a href="http://android.codtech.com/droidcon2009">Diego Torres Milano's talk on test driven development on Android</a> was something I was especially pleased to see on the programme. I advocate and use TDD in my day job (and at the <a href="http://ldnpydojo.eventwax.com/4th-london-python-dojo--meetup">code dojo</a>) &#8211; so it was great to learn how to do it on Android.</p>

	<p>As always, some of the best stuff was in the chatting over pizza / drinks and in the intervals. Lots of cool pointers and advice as well as a sneak preview of Motorola's "Droid".</p>

	<p>Great job guys and I'm looking forward to the next one&#8230; </p>

	<p>(If you can't wait there is always the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/android/">Londroid</a> group whose next meeting is on 21st January &#8211; I'll be there).</p>
