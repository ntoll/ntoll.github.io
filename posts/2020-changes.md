I've spent today updating everything to do with ntoll.org. Many
thanks to my buddy [Kushal Das](https://kushaldas.in/) for the invaluable
advice on various technical matters.

Here's what I've done:

1. The website is run using [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/) ~ a Python based
   static site generator. It was *very* easy to migrate away from my previous
   hand-coded solution made with a custom
   [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) script and HTML.
2. It's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which is both free
   and makes it very easy to manage code and deployment.
3. I've switched email hosting to [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/), who 
   made the whole migration process extraordinarily easy. 
4. I've archived the code for the old website for "safe keeping", even though
   all the content has moved over to the new site.

Lots of things have changed in addition to my own technical infrastructure.

I've just finished a very busy period of freelance work with two clients -
the [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press/) for whom I
contributed Python code to an
[application for journalists](https://securedrop.org/), and
[NHSDigital](https://digital.nhs.uk/) for whom I fulfilled the remote role of a
code mentor / developer coach (like an agile coach, but much more technical).
I was collaborating with a team of Java developers who were learning Python and
Django while building APIs for internal customers and users. I also provided
Python training, which was very rewarding since I love teaching and the
NHSDigital folks were already technically very strong and lots of fun. Both
teams were exceptionally talented and friendly. I had a blast and made lots of
new friends.

In just over a week I'll be starting a new gig with the
[Ministry of Justice](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/) as a senior Python
engineer. I'm *really* looking forward to this since the work is useful,
interesting and challenging. I'm looking forward to learning from my new
colleagues and making contributions to our collective effort.

What does this mean for all my other projects (for instance
[CodeGrades](https://codegrades.com/) or [Mu](https://codewith.mu/))..?
Ironically, I believe I'll have more rhythm to my day and so my work on these
projects will continue in my own time, but at a more predictable pace. Watch
this space. :-)

Finally, the current Corona virus pandemic is affecting life in rather
unforeseen ways: my daughter and older son have had their summer exams
cancelled. Apparently, their results will be based upon their predicted grades.
It means my daughter is going to read Mathematics at university with a
scholarship (dependent on her achieving her target grades, which she will in
light of the current situation) and my son will have the grades needed to go
onto study Physics, Maths, Music and Design Technology at "A" level (his
current plan is to read engineering at university). My youngest son continues
school lessons, completed at home via an online platform.

We've also had to purchase some home-studio equipment (mics, pre-amp, monitor
speakers, midi keyboard and related audio software). Mary, my wife, uses this
to teach her many instrumental students remotely via video calls. It soon
became apparent that laptop or mobile phone mics are not great for cello
or piano teaching. Happily, the new equipment is proving to be a great success
and Mary is able to continue teaching most students without disruption and from
the comfort of our own music room:

It also means *I* have the equipment available to produce my own (Python)
training materials and the kids are having a great time mixing all sorts of
different types of music.

Here's hoping you stay safe and remain healthy during this challenging time.
Since most of us are in lock-down, don't hesitate to get in touch if you fancy
a chat..! Social distancing rules don't mean you have to be anti-social.

:-)
