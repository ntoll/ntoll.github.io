	<p>My <a href="http://ntoll.org/article/project-an-aiml-chatterbot-in-c">original .NET chat-bot</a> was written over three years ago and was based upon the AIML specifications. It was also my first project in C# and became a vehicle for me to learn about the .NET platform.</p>

	<p>Although many people found it useful (it has been downloaded many thousands of times from this website) it was slow, not completely reliable and lacking in features.</p>

	<p>Now that I have extensive experience and knowledge of .NET, I have re-written this project from scratch to implement several modifications and improvements. These are:</p>

	<ul>

		<li>Better cross-platform compatibility. Support for .NET 1.1, 2.0 and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/XNA/default.aspx">XNA</a> as well as the open source <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">MONO project</a> (tested under version 1.1). Testing on Windows Vista with version 3.0 of the .NET platform is pending.</li>

		<li>A completely new modular architecture to make it easier for developers to extend and add functionality.</li>

		<li>A simpler and more logical API.</li>

		<li>Standards compliant AIML support with the option for custom tags.</li>

		<li>Very small size (currently only 52k).</li>

		<li>Very fast (over 30,000 categories processed in under a second).</li>

		<li>Inclusion of a comprehensive test suite including over 200 unit tests (based upon <a href="http://www.nunit.org/">nUnit</a>).</li>

		<li>A means of saving the bot's "brain" as a binary file (Graphmaster.dat). </li>

		<li>Some simple code snippets and examples for developers to get started (simple windows and console based applications as well as a sample custom tags library).</li>

		<li>Appropriately commented code.</li>

		<li>Comprehensive documentation.</li>

	</ul>

	<p>The project now has a home on <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/aimlbot">Sourceforge</a> (the open source development site) that provides bug tracking, documentation, mailing lists, public forums, source control (<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a>), file space and project management capabilities (among other things). </p>

	<p>Downloads, documentation, help and advice on implementing and using the library in your own projects can be found at the Sourceforge project page:</p>
