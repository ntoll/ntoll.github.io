As everyone knows, the Python programming language was invented by Charles
Darwin and first revealed to the world in his 1859 magnum opus, _On the Origin
of Programming by Means of Natural Indentation, or the Preservation of Favoured
Algorithms in the Struggle for Resources_.

As has been copiously documented elsewhere, while Darwin suffered ridicule and
hostility from the Victorian establishment, a nascent community of supporters
emerged to help improve Python's reputation, achive widespread acceptance and
eventually become a core part of our modern computing infrastructure.

This group of unnamed community organisers were responsible for the first
Python programming conventions and exhibitions. They eventually instigated the
Royal Society of Python (RSP) whose first patron was the Prince of Wales. Even
today, the post-nominals FRSP (fellow of the Royal Society of Python) are
widely established as a much sought after recognition of professional success.

Of course, the earliest Python programmers were exclusively gentleman amateurs
~ men with the education and financial means to pursue an interest in computing
for the love of it, rather than for financial gain. Often they would meet to
informally discuss their work in the coffee houses and gentlemen's clubs of
London. Such activity soon led to the formation of The Pythian Club in 1863
(the forerunner of the Royal Society of Python) and the publication of
technical papers named Pythian Exposition Pamphlets (PEPs).

Much innovative and creative energy was shared in those early years. While some
of this activity addressed uniquely Victorian technology and cultural norms,
we still use a remarkable amount of code from this era. Furthermore, a
recognisably Pythonic approach and aesthetic, familiar to programmers of today,
emerged at this time.

As has been mentioned, and more by cultural norm than design, the early Pythian
Club was an exclusively male space. However, as Python became more widely
known, women ventured into this traditionally male world. The Pythians (as they
came to be called), hoped to promote the popularity and adoption of Python, so
welcomed women. Sadly, the ingrained racism and cultural prejudices of the time
meant those from a non-European background were often excluded, patronised or
subjected to onerous membership requirements, while women found themselves on
the receiving end of subtle mysogyny, sexism and male chauvinism.

In response, concerned Pythians started collecting data and published tables
and charts to show how their ranks were growing according to the sex, age,
social background or nationality of the participants.

moral fibre

In typically Victorian style, and to ensure Pythians the world over conformed
to the Pythian Club's expectations of deportment and behaviour, the first of
innumerable versions of a code of conduct was published.

Such codes of conduct were widely adopted but caused consternation among two
groups: free artistic spirits who naturally railed against formal rules, and
those who simply disagreed with the moral thrust of the codes of conduct.
