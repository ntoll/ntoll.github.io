I will be at PyCon in a couple of weeks. The description I've given myself, to
be printed on my conference pass, is, "recovering former member of the Python
community".

I wish I could recapture my first steps with Python.

This post is about prejudice, morals and how we pay attention to the world.
You may find yourself angry or uncomfortable when reading this, please sit with
those feelings and read to the end. Thank you.
