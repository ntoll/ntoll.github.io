Here's a rare photograph of members of the Victorian Python community.

They are some of the early community organisers responsible for the first
Python conventions and exhibitions. They also instigated the Royal Society of
Python (RSP), whose first patron was the Prince of Wales. Even today, the
post-nominals FRSP (fellow of the Royal Society of Python) are widely
established as a much sought after recognition of professional success.

The earliest Python programmers were exclusively gentleman amateurs ~ men with
the education and means to pursue an interest in computing (for the love of it,
rather than for financial gain). Often they would meet to informally discuss
their work in the coffee houses and gentlemen's clubs of London. Such activity
soon led to the formation of The Pythian Club in 1873 (the forerunner of the
Royal Society of Python) and the publication of technical papers named
Pythian Exposition Pamphlets (PEPs). Much innovative and creative energy was
shared in those early years. While some of this activity addressed uniquely
Victorian technology, we still use a remarkable amount of code from this era,
and a recognisable aesthetic of Python, familiar to programmers of today, was
firmly established.

In the early days The Pythian Club was, more by cultural norm than design, an
exclusively male space. However, as the usefulness and applications of Python
became more widely known, women ventured into this traditionally male world.
The Pythians (as they came to be called), hoping to promote an unheard of
progressive and egalitarian adoption of Python, no matter the programmer's
background, welcomed women. In a typically programmer-ish view of the world,
the enlarged Pythians started collecting data and published tables and charts
to show how their ranks were growing according to the sex, social background or
nationality of the participants.

In typically Victorian style, and to ensure Pythians the world over conformed
to the Pythian Club's expectations of deportment and behaviour, the first of
innumerable versions of a code of conduct was published.

Such codes of conduct were widely adopted but caused consternation among two
groups: free spirits who naturally railed against formal rules, and those who
simply disagreed with the apparently progressive thrust of the codes of
conduct.
