Here's a rare photograph of some of the members of the Victorian Python
community.

These are some of the early community organisers responsible for the first
conventions and exhibitions. They also instigated the Royal Society of Python
(RSP), whose first patron was the Prince of Wales. Even today, the
post-nominals FRSP (fellow of the Royal Society of Python) are widely
established as a much sought after recognition of professional success.

The earliest Python programmers were exclusively gentleman amateurs ~ men with
the education and means to pursue an interest in computing (for the love of it,
rather than for financial gain). Often they would meet to informally discuss
their work in the coffee houses and gentlemen's clubs of London. Such activity
soon led to the formation of The Pythian Club in 1873 (the forerunner of the
Royal Society of Python) and the publication of technical papers named
Pythian Exposition Pamphlets (PEPs). Much innovative and creative energy was
shared in those early years. While some of this activity addressed uniquely
Victorian technology current at the time, we still use a remarkable amount of
code from this era, and the aesthetic of Python, that programmers of
today would recognise, was firmly established.

In the early days The Pythian Club was, more by cultural norm than design, an
exclusively male space. However, as the usefulness and applications of Python
became more widely known, women started to venture into this traditionally
male world. The Pythians (as they came to be called), hoping to promote the
an egalitarian adoption of Python no matter the programmer's background,
welcomed women. In a typically programmer-ish view of the world, the enlarged
Pythians started collecting data and published tables and charts to show how
their ranks were growing according to the social background or nationality of
the participants.
