As mentioned in the previous blog post, we want to celebrate our 25th wedding
anniversary in style. Mary suggested we walk
[Offa's Dyke](https://offasdyke.org.uk/) and I only went ahead and actually
booked it all for a twelve day hike. You see, as a devoted husband, I do as
I am told!

To say we've been looking forward to this with some trepidation is an
understatement. Since early January we've been doing several long practice
walks to ensure our equipment behaves, we understand how to pace ourselves
and feel what long (20 mile or more) walks feel like.

And today, the moment came for us to start our walk.

We arrived by train at [Chepstow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chepstow), and
booked into a guest house called, appropriately enough,
[The First Hurdle](https://thefirsthurdle.co.uk/). It happened to have an award
winning pizza parlour attached to it, so that was our evening meal sorted.
Afterwards we looked at the map and realised that we'd be walking the first
mile or so to the starting stone, only to have to retrace our steps to within
a short distance of the guest house. Given that day 1 was also the longest day
by quite some distance (19.5 miles) we thought we'd give ourselves a head start
and walk the first mile in the evening, thus saving us some time in the
morning. And so, as the dusk was falling we trekked south from Chepstow to
the starting stone.

We were _very excited_ to find the stone, look across the Severn estuary and
take in that we were taking our first steps together on a very very long
journey, just as we had done so (metaphorically speaking) all those years ago
on the day of our wedding.

In the morning, we were met at breakfast with a
[full English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_breakfast) (vegetarian) and
lots of coffee that seemed to do the trick and put the fire in our bellies. The
helpful waitress took this photo of us, just as we were about to set off.

Yes dear reader, completely independently of each other we have purchased
pretty much the same GorTex jackets and trousers, so we definitely look like a
the middle aged "Mr. and Mrs." that we so clearly and unwittingly are. :-)

I have on my phone an [Ordinance Survey](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/) app
into which I can load pre-planned [GPX files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format)
that define our route. I created our GPX routes back in January (based upon the
official "Offa's Dyke" guide - sadly Offa is no longer with us to sign such
books), and careful testing during our training sessions showed the OS app was
the clear winner for ease of use and simplicity.

However, we could have saved ourselves the trouble, because a squirrel like
ranger, with a love of acorns had clearly marked our route at every turn.
Actually, because the Offa's Dyke route is designated a [National Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Trails)
(and there are several of these in the UK) an acorn logo is used to tell you you're
on such a long distance footpath, administered and maintained by
[Natural England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_England) and
[Natural Resources Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Resources_Wales).

Another unexpectedly common feature of our walk was the large number of
[kissing gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissing_gate). I always thought
they were so named because, if you were walking with someone, the tradition
when passing through such gates, was to share a kiss. I've just looked at the
Wikipedia page (linked to above), and it appears I was wrong.

Apparently...

<blockquote>
  <q>The name comes from the gate merely "kissing" (touching) the inside of the enclosure.</q>
</blockquote>

We counted 34 such gates, and we kissed at each one. I'm not going to tell Mary
that we've got our "kissing gate" story wrong, just to see if she actually
reads this blog post..! I think our reason is far better, and certainly more
appropriate given our 25th wedding anniversary. :-)

The weather was wonderful. We had a crisp April day that was full of sunshine,
but not unbearable heat. Conditions under foot were good and we were treated to
all sorts of wonderful moments where we allowed ourselves to be in nature.

We mostly walked three types of terrain: wood, hills and river banks. I think
my favourite was the woodland walking (perhaps because I'm originally from
[Sherwood Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherwood_Forest)).

We were treated to all sorts of sensory stimulation: the smell of wild garlic,
the fresh April breeze, the sound of the river Wye along whose banks we walked,
and, of course, a lot of birdsong. I made this recording in the woods at the
top of the cliffs that overlook Tintern.

Talking of Tintern... for much of the walk we were following in the august
footsteps of [William Wordsworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wordsworth),
who wrote [Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lines_Written_a_Few_Miles_above_Tintern_Abbey).

<blockquote>
    <q>Five years have passed; five summers, with the length<br/>
Of five long winters! and again I hear<br/>
These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs<br/>
With a sweet inland murmur. — Once again<br/>
Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs,<br/>
Which on a wild secluded scene impress<br/>
Thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect<br/>
The landscape with the quiet of the sky.<br/>
The day is come when I again repose<br/>
Here, under this dark sycamore, and view<br/>
These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,<br/>
Which, at this season, with their unripe fruits,<br/>
Among the woods and copses lose themselves,<br/>
Nor, with their green and simple hue, disturb<br/>
The wild green landscape. Once again I see<br/>
These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines<br/>
Of sportive wood run wild; these pastoral farms<br/>
Green to the very door; and wreathes of smoke<br/>
Sent up, in silence, from among the trees,<br/>
With some uncertain notice, as might seem,<br/>
Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,<br/>
Or of some hermit’s cave, where by his fire<br/>
The hermit sits alone.</q>
</blockquote>

Here we are, a few miles above Tintern Abbey. We tramped the steep and lofty
cliff, saw plots of cottage ground in the villages below, and carefully found
our way through woods and copses as we travelled through the wild green
landscape.

As we descended into Brockweir we started having thoughts of food. Sadly, there
wasn't the hoped for pub, cafe or other means of nourishment. Brockweir hasn't
a lot going for it apart from the beautiful river Wye. The scenery more than
made up for the lack of food and drink!

It was as we walked north along the river bank that today's "incident" took
place. At some point, and we're not sure where or how, Mary dropped her mobile
phone. We had got about 2 miles north of Brockweir when Mary discovered her
mobile was missing. At this point we put on the hand-brake, did a swift 180
turn and stomped in completely the wrong direction while regularly phoning
Mary's missing mobile to no avail. After perhaps 1.5 miles the phone was
answered by a friendly lady.

I described myself as, "a middle age chap, wearing
a TUBA t-shirt, with a heavy backpack and staff".

She replied that she was heading north and, at this point, I could see a lady
in the distance talking on a phone. So I mentioned I was furiously waving my
staff above my head and she replied,

"Oh yes, I see you. I'll be there in 5 minutes."

Happily, Mary was reunited with her phone, but not after adding 3 miles to our
total for the day.

I wish I could say this was the only incident on day 1.

But, our naivete about the culinary qualities of Brockweir meant we didn't have
anywhere to grab lunch. As a result, we drank all our water (which was rather
concerning) and cracked open emergency supply of chocolate Easter eggs. (Just
writing this down, makes me feel stupid, dear reader.) And so the last few
miles into Redbrook was more of a struggle than they should have been given
our empty tummies and the onset of thirst.

Yet, as with our journey through life, we both enjoyed ourselves during the
good times (for instance, walking in the woods), and supported and encouraged
each other when faced with a challenge. I can happily report both Mary and I,
on different occasions, helped the other overcome their moaning. ;-)

Here's Mary, descending into Redbrook with [Monmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monmouth)
in the distance.

Happily, Redbrook had a pub.

Unhappily, we were too late for food.

However, I think I consumed the world's best pint of bitter and packet of
salt and vinegar crisps whilst in that drinking establishment... or at least,
that's how it felt, and after 20 minutes of resting and enjoying our
repast, we creaked back into gear for the final push to Monmouth.

When we arrived at the [Queen's Head Inn](https://queensheadmonmouth.co.uk/) we
were cheerfully greeted by Neil, the publican, who made us feel very welcome
and recommended a fantastic Italian restaurant for our evening meal. I'm not
sure what the waiters made of us, but I think we set some sort of speed of
eating record in their restaurant, because we woofed down some amazing, fresh
and locally sourced Italian cuisine.

As I write this post, below us we hear live music from the bar, and Mary and I
will soon descend for a final drink, and listen to the music for a while before
a well deserved sleep.

Finally, here's a map of the route we covered today. We're not quite sure how
far we _actually_ walked, given the unplanned repeat of the river walk, but we
think we managed somewhere north of 22 miles.

Tomorrow we head to Llangattock Lingoed, which is, as far as we can tell,
completely in the middle of nowhere. As a result, we've spied a good bakery
in Monmouth and will stock up with provisions for tomorrow and the day
after (which will end in Hay-on-Wye).

Onwards! :-)
