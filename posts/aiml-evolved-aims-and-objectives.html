	<h2>Program#</h2>

	<p>My <a href="http://ntoll.org/article/project-an-aiml-chatterbot-in-c">original .NET chat-bot</a> was written over three years ago and is based upon the <a href="http://www.alicebot.org/">AIML</a> specifications. It was also my first project in C# and became a vehicle for me to learn about the .NET platform. </p>

	<p>Now that I have extensive experience and knowledge of .NET, I am re-designing this library to include several modifications and improvements. The <em>definite</em> modifications will be (in no particular order):</p>

	<ul>

		<li>Better cross-platform compatibility: .NET 1.1 and 2.0 as well as MONO support.</li>

		<li>A significant change in the architecture of the library (more modular to make it easier for developers to extend and add functionality).</li>

		<li>Better (i.e. more efficient and standards-compliant) AIML support.</li>

		<li>A simpler and more logical API.</li>

	</ul>

	<p>I also <em>aim</em> (but no promises) to include the following features (in order of priority):</p>

	<ul>

		<li>A means of saving the bot's "brain" as a binary file. Loading a binary file into memory will be significantly faster than having to re-load and process the AIML every time the software starts up.</li>

		<li>The option to run the library with at least two different types of backend: 

	<ul>

		<li>The regular in-memory "brain" built from the AIML or binary file described above.</li>

		<li>A relational database (initially SQL Server2000/2005, MySql and PostgreSQL) and associated code to import and process the AIML into a relational structure.</li>

	</ul></li>

		<li>The implementation of some non-AIML compliant learning algorithms so the bot's vocabulary and scope for conversation grows.</li>

		<li>User profiling for better awareness of conversational context. </li>

		<li>Some simple code snippets and examples for developers to get started.</li>

	</ul>

	<h2>ProgramR</h2>

	<p>In addition to the work on Program#, I have been in touch with the developers of a Ruby version of the standard AIML bot (<a href="http://projects.dottorsi.com/programr">ProgramR</a>). </p>

	<p>By their own admission, the project is very much "<em>alpha</em>" code. I am going to spend time contributing to this project as both a bug fixer and implementer of new features. </p>

	<p>My reasons for doing this are to:</p>

	<ul>

		<li><em>Deepen</em> my understanding of the capabilities and stylistic conventions of the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby programming language</a>.</li>

		<li><em>Advance</em> ProgramR to the same level of maturity as Program#.</li>

		<li><em>Help</em> bring into existence something insanely useful.</li>

		<li><em>Create</em> a platform upon which new chat-bot techniques can be easily tried and tested.</li>

	</ul>

	<p>Ultimately, both Program# and ProgramR will implement only the minimum of required features in the simplest, easiest and most helpful way possible and become solid foundations upon which bespoke systems can be built.</p>
