(Some raw thoughts I've written down solely to help me clarify my thinking.)

Being together with people I love and who love me in return is a source of
great joy and solace.

Yet being with people can also lead to distress.

Like many, I've encountered rejection and resulting feelings of loneliness,
I've been the target of ignorant nastiness, and some make it clear I am of no
value while others happily place unreasonable burdens upon me. My own
experiences are but a small selection from the menu of unwelcome situations
that could be, and often are, meted out to people.

Dealing with complicated experiences and finding a way to work through
challenging encounters often feels painful and can lead to a sense of failure
or hopelessness. But I believe this process is also an opportunity for growth,
albeit through small, difficult, and often misplaced, steps. Allowing
complicated feelings, pain and failure to manifest is certainly better than the
alternative: sweeping things out of sight means the distress is never
addressed, explored or dealt with.

So, being together requires conscious work and reflection.

The good stuff can take as much effort as the bad. To be loving, compassionate,
tolerant and forgiving towards others requires great strength of character. The
bad stuff shows we are all flawed sensitive beings whose strength often fails
us. We have an endless capacity to hurt and be hurt by each other. This is
especially true if we don't allow ourselves the time and energy to reflect upon
and consciously adjust our behaviour towards each other.

Sadly, some simply don't care for others or for such self reflection.

For example, narcissists (by definition) lack empathy or compassion and only
make an effort in relationships if they see a benefit to themselves. This is a
tragic form of ignorance, for they will never know the joy of relationships
shared with loved ones who reciprocate emotional investment and mutual care.
For them, being together is an exercise in self aggrandisement, domination or
profit.

Ironically, the origins of such self-centredness are complicated, so worthy of
introspection and self-reflection ~ the very traits such people fail to
exercise. Everyone has a unique and valuable journey through life, even if
their current location or direction of travel is deeply problematic.
Recognising this with a narcissist, making it possible to be together without
getting crushed by the weight of their ego, takes (the afore mentioned)
strength of character. Sadly, sometimes this is simply not possible and you
have to cut your losses and move on.

I often wonder how to respond to the difficulties that arise from being
together with others. My feelings about about this subject have changed
significantly over the past couple of years. 

I continue to believe that being together is usually a privilege and a source
of happiness and growth. Yet some of my recent collaborations have also been a
source of great pain (interactions with aspects of the Python community
[spring to mind](https://ntoll.org/article/compassion/)).

I used to be all about promoting "the community" as a way of being together.
An immediate problem is "the community" is an amorphous blob of a
term that folks never pin down. This is a significant cause of many problems as
misunderstanding is rife. In any case, I naively contributed and volunteered my
code, time, effort and money. In short, I tried very hard to be a positive part
of "something". For the past 12 years or so, this "something" was the Python
programming community.

I've always been reticent about "top down" notions of community. They are
bureaucratic, formal and hierarchical in nature. I'm afraid I've seen such
notions tragically, incompetently or unintentionally undermined (at best), or
turned into toxic dumpster fires full of malice (at worst). While my experience
of the "formal" Python community has mostly been extraordinarily positive,
there has been enough not-so-good-stuff that I've ended up choosing to step
away.

But I don't want to find myself in a chaotic "bottom up" community either.
While these are ad hoc, improvised and informal, there is still a hierarchy,
along with impositions of power and other negative political machinations.
These are lived out through hidden communication channels, gossip or because
the loudest or most charismatic folks hold the floor. People are either "in"
or "out" of the circle of these "movers and shakers".

At least more formal communities appear to be up front about hierarchy, the
exercise of power, the scope and relations of roles and how one assumes
positions therein..!

For me the key is personal character - of both myself (how I reflect and
choose to behave) and the others with whom I find myself.

I'm reminded of [this rather interesting essay](https://www.lewissociety.org/innerring/),
by C.S.Lewis. I first read it when I was a music undergraduate and found it via
a Christian room-mate. Lewis describes an "Inner Ring", something akin to the
circle of "movers and shakers" vying for influence, power and prestige that I
describe above. The part of the essay that most speaks to me, comes at the very
end:

> "And if in your spare time you consort simply with the people you like, you
> will again find that you have come unawares to a real inside: that you are
> indeed snug and safe at the centre of something which, seen from without,
> would look exactly like an Inner Ring. But the difference is that the secrecy
> is accidental, and its exclusiveness a by-product, and no one was led thither
> by the lure of the esoteric: for it is only four or five people who like one
> another meeting to do things that they like. This is friendship. Aristotle
> placed it among the virtues. It causes perhaps half of all the happiness in
> the world, and no Inner Ring can ever have it."

Reaching back in time to feel like my 18 year old self again, I want to be with
folks who are open to compassionate, collaborative, cooperative ways of working
but without any extra problematic notions of "community" (as described above).
I simply want to bring myself, and welcome others who want to join me into
place where there's a connection, frisson or creative energy from which we can
mutually grow.

In other words, I am inviting friendship.

Friendship requires trust, honesty, tolerance, compassion and forgiveness...
all those things that depend upon strength of character. Putting in such effort
for others is the antipode of the machinations needed to be one of the "in"
crowd.

So here's the thing... the tech world has its fair share of folks who forget
what makes a place positive, friendly and safe when being with each other. Such
folks see collaboration in terms of gaining access to the "in" crowd, prestige
and power. This is the stuff of narcissistic day dreams.

In an organised community such behaviour is addressed by a code of
conduct (and the Python community spend a lot of time and energy acting on this
~ with varying degrees of success, from hollow virtue signalling through to
some very effective networks of support). Conversely, the informal communities
tend to lack these sorts of public or explicit "frameworks" often with
detrimental results (folks are able to capitalize, abuse or manipulate the
informal "hidden" networks and relationships to selfish or unpleasant ends).

It's why I've found myself writing a sort of personal code I call
"[on being together](https://github.com/ntoll/being_together)". Encountering
[Xe's Creator's Code](https://github.com/Xe/creators-code) inspired this
effort.  It's very much a work in progress and has become an expression of what
you can expect from me and what I may expect from you should we find ourselves
"being together" in a place to collaborate or work with each other:

<blockquote>
<br/>
When working together or if things go wrong,<br/>
we acknowledge and work through differences.<br/>
In so doing, we transform and enlarge each other.<br/>
<br/>
To nurture our mutual growth,<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is a place of<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;learning, understanding, and sharing;<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is a place to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;affirm tolerance and compassion;<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is a place for<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collaborative creativity.<br/>
<br/>
All the aspects of yourself you choose to bring to this place<br/>
are welcome here.<br/>
<br/>
Reciprocate! Welcome, embrace and learn from others<br/>
(even in the face of apparent hostility or misunderstanding).<br/>
<br/>
To act against this spirit invites ostracism,<br/>
a loss that diminishes us all.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.
