I have LOTS of projects (software, [classical] music, gardening, writing, goofy
stuff) that I share with LOTS of different folks. This is a privilege and a
source of happiness and growth; yet it has also been a source of pain
(interactions with aspects of the Python community spring to mind).

My feelings and thinking about collaboration have changed significantly over
the past couple of years.

I used to be all about promoting "the community" (a sort of amorphous blob of
folks rallying under a banner - e.g. #python), contributing and volunteering my
code, time, effort and money, and generally trying hard to be a positive part
of "something" (the aforementioned amorphous blob). For the past 12 years or
so, this was the organised Python programming community, but it has also
included various formal and informal educational and musical stuff too.

Now my feeling is that I want nothing to do with any notion of "community" in
an organised, formal or hierarchical sense. I'm afraid I've seen such notions
tragically or unintentionally undermined (at best), or turned into toxic
dumpster fires full of malice (at worst). While my experience of the Python
community has mostly been extraordinarily positive, there was enough
not-good-stuff that I've ended up stepping away.

Yet I don't want to find myself in a chaotic "bottom up" ad hoc space either.
My experience of such communities is that there's still a hierarchy, along with
impositions of power and other negative political machinations. These are often
lived out via a hidden or tacit hierarchy or communication channels. Often the
loudest or most charismatic people hold sway and folks are either "in" or "out"
of the circle of those "movers and shakers"
([this rather interesting essay](https://www.lewissociety.org/innerring/), by
C.S.Lewis of all people, actually captures aspects of what I'm talking about
quite well, in a dated sort of a way if you can see past the 1950s era
language).

At least the formal communities are mostly up front about the hierarchy, the
exercise of power, the scope and relations of roles and how one assumes
positions therein..!

Rather, I want to continue to work with folks who are open to compassionate,
collaborative, cooperative ways of working but without any extra notions of
"community" (as described above). I want to simply bring myself, and welcome
others who also bring themselves to a place where there's a connection, frisson
or creative energy from which we can mutually grow.

My inevitable musical analogy is that it's the difference in scale and
(inter-personal) dynamics between a string quartet and a full scale
professional symphony orchestra or an amateur community choir. I guess I'm
thinking out loud about a "chamber community" (viz, the scale and nature of
"chamber music"), rather than the more common concert-hall scale music making.
I may even be describing a camerata of sorts. (?)

So here's the thing... the tech world is (sadly) full of enough folks who still
need reminding what makes a place positive, friendly and safe when working with
each other.

In a well organised community setting this would be covered by a code of
conduct (and the Python community spend a lot of time and energy acting on this
~ to varying degrees of success from hollow virtue signalling through to some
very effective networks of support). Conversely, the informal communities tend
to lack these sorts of public or explicit "frameworks" with often detrimental
results (folks are able to capitalize, abuse or manipulate the informal
"hidden" networks and relationships to selfish or unpleasant ends).

It's why I've found myself writing this - a sort of personal code I call
"on being together". It's very much a work in progress and has become an
expression of what you can expect from me and what I may expect from you should
we find ourselves "being together" in a place and collaborating or working
together. Coming into contact with Xe's Creator's Code started the ball
rolling.

Like I said, thoughts, ideas, feedback and constructive critique most welcome
since I'm painfully aware that I write from rather a privileged position that
will have plenty of blind spots.

Thank you..!
