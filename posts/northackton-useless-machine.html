<p>When time permits I really enjoy attending
<a href="http://northackton.stdin.co.uk/blog/">Northackton</a>, a local hacker
/ maker group. Last Monday I took my middle son, Sam (8 years old), along to
a meeting advertised as a "geek santa" session - an opportunity for attendees
to build a geeky gift for a loved one in time for Christmas.</p>

<p>We were all there to make
<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Most-Useless-Machine/step1/Background/">useless machines</a> - wonderfully quirky devices imagined by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifical_Intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a> pioneer
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky">Marvin Minsky</a>
and first built by the father of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Theory">information theory</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Claude Shannon</a>.</p>

<p>Between ten to fifteen of us turned up to be greeted by
friend-of-Northackton <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/msraynsford/">Martin Raynsford</a>.
Martin provided us all with kits (also available via
<a href="http://msraynsford.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/new-smaller-useless-box.html">his website</a>), instructions, encouragement and a helping
hand when required. After a couple of hours we were all the proud owners of a
working useless machine! Sam was especially pleased because he had a go
soldering and the other attendees were very patient (and welcoming) by
answering all his inevitable questions. He was also very impressed with the
well provisioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuck_shop">tuck
shop</a> (lots of chocolate and crisps!).</p>

<p>But, what is a useless machine..? I'll let Sam explain...</p>
