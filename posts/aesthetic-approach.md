This article may only make sense to those for whom such thoughts are already
familiar. That things don't make sense from a certain point of view is
actually a core aspect of this article (viz. "brain twists").

In the latter years of the 19th century the
[Arts and Crafts movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement)
grew from the ideas and work of
[John Ruskin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ruskin), 
[William Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morris) and their
collaborators. Rather than a particular artistic style, it was an approach to
community organisation, an appreciation of the impulse behind artistic
endeavours, and an attitude to the process of creating and making.

Work within this movement was diverse in style, execution and medium:
it could encompass a colourful and richly decorated stained glass window, a
simple rustic wooden table, medieval inspired typefaces, arboreal silverware,
classical music inspired by English folksong or Renaissance composers,
wallpaper patterns made from stylised tessellation of plants and animals, a
red-brick neo-Gothic family home, and political, commercial or religious
organisations with a vernacular, cooperative, emergent and egalitarian outlook.

Arts and Crafts was a reaction to the worst of the British Industrial
Revolution: ornate and over-elaborate massed produced objects shoddily created
via mechanised factories, ignorant of the qualities of the materials used nor
the lives, skills and culture[s] of the workers involved. For the Arts and
Crafts movement such objects, and the practices used to create them, had a
detrimental effect on our world and the lives lived within it.

Arts and Crafts engaged with, and was an alternative perspective to, the
complicated cultural and commercial status quo of its time. It emerged as an
influential and widely admired movement that is
[still popular today](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/apr/11/the-guardian-view-on-william-morris-how-the-strawberry-thief-took-over-the-world).

What could we learn and recapture from the Arts and Crafts, as we reflect upon
the equivalent knotty aspects of our own contemporary culture? It's plausible
that shallow brand-led consumerism, unconscious automated manufacturing,
efficiency obsessed supply chain practices and technology-enabled
[surveillance capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism)
(that dominate our contemporary culture) are correspondingly damaging to the
environment and our ability to lead flourishing and fulfilling lives.

For me, the alternative perspective of the Arts and Crafts resonates.

Why?

Because it's about paying attention.

How we pay attention reveals the world in a certain sort of way. Such attention
changes the world through our embodying subsequent understanding,
interpretation and reaction to things _from that certain perspective_.
Reflecting upon how one pays attention is, therefore, of fundamental
importance. For such introspection cultivates a more enlarged and multifarious
encounter with the world: an opportunity to become conscious of how one's own
attention changes and is changed, while it is itself changing the world in
which we live. Put succinctly, pay attention to paying attention!

In [previous blog posts](/article/why-computers-1/) I've described this way of
paying attention as a _brain twist_: the challenge to acquire a new perspective
about seemingly everyday things. The external world remains as it was, but you
have changed and thus see the world differently by paying attention with the
benefit of a new perspective. It's that "aha" feeling when a cartoon lightbulb
appears above your head.

Here's an aesthetic example of such a change of attention, from the perspective
of the Arts and Crafts movement.

In a [famous passage](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/29906/pg29906-images.html#page028)
from [Modern Painters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Painters), John
Ruskin gave a celebrated definition of two types of beauty. The first, which he
called "typical" beauty, is easy to understand because it is conventional.
Typical beauty is the external quality of an object - how it may
appear to us through our senses, "whether it occurs in a stone, flower, beast
or man". The second, "vital" beauty, is where I find the brain twist. For it
encompasses the, "felicitous fulfilment of function in living things" and the,
"joyful and right exertion of perfect life". In other words, vital beauty 
relates to the quality of the expressive, moral and social effects of a work.
As Ruskin put it, "the art of any country is the exponent of its social and
political values".

In _Modern Painters_ Ruskin defended the later paintings of
[J.M.W. Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._W._Turner) that were
savaged by art critics of the time. Ruskin felt that to perfectly
capture a scene with great accuracy (as one may naively suggest a photograph
might do) is a fools' game because, "no good work whatever can be perfect, and
the demand for perfection is always a sign of a misunderstanding of the ends of
art". From Ruskin's perspective, this is because nothing can be completely
seen, since the painter always creates via their own limited experience of the
scene: from their unique (and thus incomplete) point
of view. In the works of Turner Ruskin found an artist who expressed, through
their paintings, a more fundamental way to pay attention to a scene. For
Ruskin, Turner's focus was not how "real" or "accurate" the painting looked
(the "typical") but how he, the painter, sees the more meaningful ("vital")
aspects the scene. Such vital aspects are expressed through the skillful use of
colour, contrasting light and shade, or brush techniques that subtly suggest,
rather than accurately capture, the presence of things in the scene. Turner's
genius is to give a more honest and truthful rendition of a scene _as the
artist sees it_, although this actually makes the painting appear more unreal
from a "typical" and thus incomplete point of view.

The "vital" aspects of Turner's
[The Slave Ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Slave_Ship) (shown above)
encompass Turner's moral and political view of the scene - acknowledging the
horrific events carried out by slavers, throwing overboard the dead and dying
as a storm brews in the distance. Turner's work ensures the viewer has an
opportunity to encounter and reflect upon such deeper and more meaningful
aspects of the painting ~ above and beyond a superficially "accurate" rendition
of the scene. I find myself first seeing a seascape with a dramatic sunset,
then I notice the tall ship careering into a storm that looks like a demonic
presence reaching into the painting from the left hand side. Finally
I notice figures at the bottom of the scene in the foreground: a tangle of
limbs and chains, into which I'm dismayed to discover are painted sea creatures
and gulls feeding on those cast overboard. That I notice the human tragedy last
of all is telling: Turner forces me to acknowledge my lack of awareness of
the situation of slaves... followed by the self-realisation that such a lack of
paying attention to slaves is perhaps a typical response from someone
ignorantly encountering slavery.

It stops me in my tracks.

It is powerful stuff.

I am deeply moved.

Notice this depends upon my paying attention to the painting in a certain
receptive manner (sympathetic to the "vital" beauty contained therein). Were I
ignorant of Ruskin's brain-twist I may remark that the picture is just a
messy and not especially convincing picture of a ship.

This is where the industrial revolution went wrong (from the point of view of
Arts and Crafts): by focusing on the superficially typical beauty of mass
manufactured objects at the expense of sharing and exploring works of vital
beauty and depth.

Does this feel familiar?

Let's consider for a moment a corresponding view of the computerised world of
the 21st century.

The typically beautiful looking social media app lacks the vital beauty of
promoting a fulfilling and flourishing social life. Rather, it's a nefarious
vehicle for shallow gossip and the delivery of (typically beautiful looking)
adverts based upon invasive data collection. Your calorie counting app might
help you measure your typical energy intake, but it isn't enlarging your
awareness of the vitally delicious, healthy and skillfully prepared food you
_could_ be eating as part of a healthy lifestyle. It's actually a very specific
and not particularly nourishing way of paying attention to the world (in fact,
it's a tragically shallow and joyless exercise in data collection). The
typically hi-tech coffee maker in your kitchen constantly reminds you of its
presence via an app or glowing display that indicates the levels of coffee
beans, water and limescale, and instantly gives you a cup of coffee at the
touch of a button. How convenient? Alas, the vital and gentle ceremony of
brewing coffee in a pot with the associated sensory and emotional stimulation
it creates - the smell it produces, the relaxing aural experience of the
bubbling sound or the opportunity to lovingly prepare a cup of coffee for
someone else - is lost to a device that may look sleek and modern yet has all
the lovability of a spare part for a
[Dalek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek).

The qualities of such artifacts reflect our way of paying attention to the
world. As my examples demonstrate, at this moment in time our culture is often
tragically obsessed with typical beauty and efficient convenience while
ignoring or squashing latent vital beauty and the possibility for gentle and
nourishing rituals or encounters with others. Furthermore, our culture has an
unhealthy obsession with data and quantitive measurement as a means to
"accurately" (typically) describe the world. To be clear, I'm not against data
gathering nor quantitive measurement - these are demonstrably very useful and
often essential for hoped-for outcomes and important informative analysis. The
problem is with our attention: the tragically ignorant or inappropriate way to
engage with and pay attention to the world in a relentlessly quantitive manner
(we've measured it, so it must be true!). For instance, focusing on the number
of "likes" on a social media post to indicate a meaningful social life, or
counting calories as a proxy for healthy living, or coffee bean status as an
important aspect of enjoying a drink with your loved one at breakfast.

Such misplacement of attention has an unfortunate side effect, a sort of self
fulfilling aspect. By choosing to pay attention to things in a quantitive
manner - a manner that gives an (apparently) clear "typical" answer - we get
into a situation where anything that gives such an answer becomes priority. We
become blind to the vital process or quality of expressing other aspects of the
world in perhaps more creative, intuitive, subtle or nuanced ways. The world
is not black and white, nor even shades of grey, but full of colour, texture
and subtlety (like a Turner painting).

Remember, it's not quantitive measurement that's at fault here (as I mentioned,
that's often very useful!). Rather, it's our misplaced attention that's causing
the problem. Such misplaced emphasis of attention inevitably leads to a
crushingly banal and limited view of the world.

It's not fun. It's not rewarding. It's not even helpful.

In fact, it's probably dangerous because it ignores all the things that make
life worth living: a fluid aesthetic process of encountering, understanding and
expressing. Hence the importance of paying attention to "paying attention" to
enlarge our encounters with the world and each other.

Here's another brain twist: my complaints are perennial, for every age is full
of arty-farty humanist aesthetes (like me) bemoaning the shallowness of their
contemporary culture.

The folks working within the Arts and Crafts movement realised this and
deliberately emphasised the vital aspects of their work, culture[s] and
collaborations. For example, William Morris encouraged _useful work_ over
_useless toil_ and emphasised meaning and respect when collaborating. Their
approach often favoured synthesis of vernacular traditions over a reductionist
analysis of "products", in the belief that the quality of the work thus created
reflects the qualities of the culture in which it originated. For Morris, one
should be fulfilled by such work, created within a recognisably vernacular (and
thus authentic) shared cultural tradition, rather than crushed or alienated by
artefacts made via automated production processes. Such work is expressed
from the bottom up - from those crafting the work - rather than through a
managed top down technocratic structure. For the Arts and Crafts practitioner,
their technique is at the service of expression rather than merely a means of
production.

Of course, if you only pay attention to the world in this more "aesthetic"
manner, you are just as incomplete and blind as those caught up in just a
"typical" accurate view of the world.

Once again, the key is to pay attention to "paying attention". Is the sort of
attention you bring to a situation the one that best reveals what's going on,
or perhaps


this way of paying attention is completely inappropriate if your
work 







How do we pay attention to coding..?

There is no wealth but life (Ruskin).

Riches we have won, but wealth is absent.

Clever but unintelligent views of the world.

As artists mature their wisdom is
shared through their works of art. Their presence embodies and makes available
their acquired and unique perspective (to those who will engage). Most coders
are beginners, so the path to wisdom is important.

Our self-value, if expressed as something outside of ourselves, will always be
unrequited. Cultivating those vital aspects of the world that grow self-worth
from within is the work of a lifetime. Our current culture, of problems to be
fixed, arbitrary achievements to unlock and worth expressed as a measurable
external quantity (typically money, number of cars, size of home etc) is the
antithesis of this most important work.

Literalism is ignorance.

Linear v Gestalt view of the world. The myth of progress. JIRA!

Translate, Transform, and Transmit.

    Translate: The first, and most essential task (literally) is to understand the meaning of what has been handed down to you from the past, whether that culture was secular or religious in nature; you must understand the why of the beliefs, doctrines, laws, holidays, festivals, customs, myths, works of art, etc. Whether you grew up watching Passion plays or playing video games, or both, your maturation into true individuality will not begin unless you undertake this inquiry as to why these works of many human imaginations has been presented to you and what they are trying to teach you, to what end they are trying to guide you.

    Transform: The second part of this task is to update that meaning with the new information that you encounter in your life, information that was not a part of what was handed down to you. What we inherit from the past is the product of the dead, who lived in different circumstances than what we live in now, and was informed by their experiences; it must be brought back to life and sustained through new information, new insights into what it is to be human, and our living experiences. This is the first step of a creative process: what might it be possible for what we have been handed to become? This also requires participation in and engagement with the culture and the people in it, sharing your understanding, gaining from theirs, synthesizing, debating.

    Transmit: Our final responsibility is to create: new artistic forms, new laws, new myths, new institutions, new traditions, new philosophies, new disciplines, new industries. Having successfully understood and adapted ourselves and our way of life to the flux and impermanence of Life, we must transmit this body of knowledge and wisdom (and errors and folly) to the next generation, so that they may do the same, that every generation might suffer less and live more fully than the one before it, might have a richer understanding of where they came from and what they might be able to achieve.
