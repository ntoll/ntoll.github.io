<p>I was invited to the world's first EdFoo conference, held at Google's HQ in
California over the weekend of the 19th-21st February.</p>

<p>Foo? Yes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp">Foo</a> (aka
Friends Of <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a>).</p>

<p>I've written three books for O'Reilly, the last one being a short report on
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/python-in-education.csp">Python in Education</a>.
I suspect that's how I got on the invite list. EdFoo, as the name suggests, was
a self-organised conference about education and I'm pleased I was able to
attend. (I'm also indebted to the
<a href="https://www.python.org/psf/">Python Software Foundation</a>
for their support via a travel grant to cover my flight from the UK.)</p>

<p>I had a fantastic time with good omens from the start: I flew to San
Francisco on an almost-empty plane. Even the US border guard wanted a friendly
chat. Apparently, "all you English people drink tea with your pinky stuck out
because it helps balance the cup." Who was I to argue with the fierce looking
dude in a uniform whose decision it was for my entry into the US..? "Hahaha,
yes... of course we do, all the time..." I smiled back.</p>

<p>I took a shared shuttle from the airport to the hotel. My fellow passengers
were a French dude who didn't know where he was going ("But I 'erv ze adresse
'ere. Non, non, non... ze adresse iz 'ere someware. Non. Ici. Oui. Ah, non..."
etc), and a young Indian chap arriving to start his first job out of college at
Google. After dropping the lost Frenchman in the middle of nowhere (he insisted
it was the correct location) we chatted about cricket, much to the
consternation of our American driver. It's like a
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/learningenglish/2011/09/howzat.shtml">secret code</a>
only commonwealth citizens appear to understand. :-)</p>

<p>While driving I was reminded of the Dionne Warwick song, "Do You Know the
Way to San Jose?". I was ACTUALLY ON THE BLOODY WAY to San Jose. It's a four
lane motorway. In future I can truthfully shout "YES!" whenever I hear the song
played on the radio.</p>

<p>Foo camps are a sort of un-conference: the programme is organised by the
attendees whilst at the event. A pre-prepared blank timetable and large
sticky-notes are used to create a schedule. Interest in various activities is
indicated by the copious use of sticky spots.</p>

<p>As you can see, I contributed a session about the
<a href="https://www.microbit.co.uk/">BBC micro:bit project</a>.
People were very interested in the crazy notion of giving every 11 year-old in
the UK a small programmable computer.</p>

<p>There were lots of wonderful aspects to this conference:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The people were, without exception, smart, friendly and
    enthusiastic;</li>
    <li>The sessions were stimulating, lively and diverse in scope;</li>
    <li>It was safe to contribute and I (personally) always got back more
    because of putting in.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since I didn't know anybody, I was at my most gregarious. For example, at
meal times I'd choose a table at random and ask, "can I join you?".</p>

<p>Here's a typical encounter:</p>

<p>"Of course!" replies the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Reidenberg">friendly looking
lady</a>.</p>

<p>I discover that she's a professor of anatomy, makes BAFTA award winning
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Nature's_Giants">TV programmes</a>
and has a passion for whales. We talk on a diverse range of subjects and my
tuba playing background comes up. It launches us into a discussion
about the anatomy of circular breathing and how this is something whales may
do when vocalising whale song. We're joined by a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Laitman">trombone playing colleague</a>
of hers and have a lovely time geeking out with stories of whales, youthful
musical adventures, and anatomy.</p>

<p>Thank you Joy and Jeffrey for such an impromptu and entertaining lunch.</p>

<p>I took part in a wide variety of sessions. Highlights included a technical
description of how <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> kernels work
(more on this below), a discussion about the mechanics of curriculum generation
and accidentally walking into a stimulating and enjoyable seminar attempting to
work out why real schools are not like EdFoo.</p>

<p>It was a great pleasure to collaborate in such conversations. Often, the
person who convened each session merely got the ball rolling. There
was enough intellectual momentum in the room that conversation kept on rolling
in all sorts of interesting directions.</p>

<p>My own session was a case in point. I spent about 15 minutes giving a brief
overview of the micro:bit project, my contribution via the Python programming
language and a demonstration of the device. Questions followed but it was most
fun when I gave out a handful of devices for people to play with. I learned
that Americans call crocodile clips, "alligator clips" so settled on calling
them crocogator clips for the sake of trans-Atlantic harmony. I also learned
that Chromebooks are popular in US schools. A
<a href="http://www.tufts.edu/~crogers/">professor of mechanical
engineering</a> even got excited enough to grab his laptop and implement a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabVIEW">LabVIEW</a> based controller
to drive the micro:bit via the MicroPython REPL. It was very rewarding for me
to see a diverse bunch have such fun exploring and experimenting
with the device. I also had lots of post-session questions in the corridor
since several people couldn't make my session because it clashed with other
stuff.</p>

<p>I was conscious that EdFoo wasn't just a case of "Nicholas is off on a
jolly" (as my wonderful wife puts it). I went with an open mind but was
determined that there be tangible results from my attendance. Fortunately,
the very first session I attended offered just such an opportunity.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> project is written in Python
and provides a means of presenting code, text and other digital assets in a
sort of interactive notebook. If you're not technical, imagine if Leonardo's
notebooks were interactive and reacted to a reader's modifications - that's
what reading a Jupyter notebook feels like. I hope the educational potential of
this tool is obvious.</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/edfoo-leonardo.jpg" alt="Leonardo Notebook"/></p>

<p>The session on Jupyter was led by the creator of the project,
<a href="http://fperez.org/">Fernando Perez</a>, and included contributions
from Jupyter users as diverse as Google's Director of Research,
<a href="http://www.norvig.com/">Peter Norvig</a>, Professor of Physics,
<a href="https://about.me/lorenabarba">Lorena Barba</a> and staff from
O'Reilly, who use Jupyter
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/jupyter-at-oreilly">as a
publishing platform</a>.</p>

<p>As the session progressed it became clear notebooks record an interactive
and engaging record of the author's movement of thought. As Norvig demonstrated,
it's possible to change the code contained in a notebook and "poke it with a
stick" as it were. Readers get to follow the author's train of thought but also
pause and play with code to test their understanding of the concepts
contained therein. As code is modified outputs automatically update (i.e.
generated content within the notebook reacts to a reader's intervention).</p>

<p>I wondered how a teacher in the UK could use such a tool to deliver Python
lessons to children. Could Jupyter be used to create and share interactive
resources for the BBC micro:bit? I asked a few pointedly technical
questions and discovered the presentation and evaluation of notebooks
is separated. Presentation is done in a browser whereas evaluation of code is
done in a "kernel". "How hard is it to write a kernel?" I asked. "It's well
documented", answered an unsuspecting Fernando.</p>

<p>That afternoon I hacked together a new kernel to interact with a BBC
micro:bit. I was able to control the micro:bit attached to my laptop from
within a notebook in my browser. It took me about an hour and proved to be
remarkably simple. Later in the weekend I integrated the Jupyter Qt widget into
my <a href="https://github.com/ntoll/mu">Mu code editor</a> for children,
teachers and beginner programmers. Upon reflection, this is perhaps not the way
to go - I believe the web-based version of Jupyter is superior. Happily, it's
relatively easy to embed a browser into a Qt application like Mu so watch this
space! I'm giving a presentation at next weekend's Raspberry Pi birthday
conference about Mu, so I'll reveal what I've been up to as a part of my talk.
It'll be interesting to see what reaction I get - especially from teachers.</p>

<p>I was also intrigued by the Jupyter contribution from O'Reilly. They've
built some sort of authoring platform on top of Jupyter and gave a quick demo
of Norvig working his way through a problem. I asked if it was open source
to which the O'Reilly people responded that it wasn't. I pointed out that if
it wasn't then someone would be bound to copy and re-create it. I think there
was a bit of misunderstanding or crossed wires: perhaps the O'Reilly people
thought I was talking about their (excellent) content. I was actually referring
to the authoring platform they appear to have created on top of Jupyter. I
imagine teachers would have a fantastic time with such a tool. I know of
several secondary teachers in the UK who'd lap it up.</p>

<p>The other practical take-away from the conference was via a conversation
with an educator who used Google's Chromebooks. These cheap and simple laptop
computers are apparently very popular in schools in both the US and UK. "Can
I use my micro:bit with a Chromebook?" was their concern.</p>

<p>Why yes, is <a href="https://github.com/ntoll/python-native-editor">my
response</a>.</p>

<p>I've adapted the web-based editor I wrote for the "official" BBC website
and, via the magic of Chrome's serial API, added a REPL client so kids can
interactively program their devices.</p>

<p>:-)</p>

<p>Yet another highlight was breakfast on Sunday morning: I had a lot of fun
creating squishy circuits (they're made from a sort of dough) and had a
professor of electrical engineering from MIT show me how to make a simple LED
flashy thingamabob that makes a great light display in a dark room.</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/foo-squishy.jpg" alt="Squishy circuits"/></p>

<p>It's such fun to play!</p>

<p>Only 50% of the attendees are invited back. If I'm not, I'd love my
place to be taken by someone from the UK. If there's but one
criticism of the conference it is that it mainly involved people from the US.
There's a huge amount of innovation, experimentation and success happening in
education in the wider world. EdFoo could be a wonderful opportunity to bring
an international and diverse group of education pioneers together. Since I'm
making "moon on a stick" suggestions, my vote would be to hold it in Athens,
the home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum (but I'm biased because I'm
European and have a background in Philosophy).</p>

<p>Finally, sincere thanks to our hosts, Google, who did a magnificent job. I
was particularly amused by the available WiFi SSIDs. :-)</p>
