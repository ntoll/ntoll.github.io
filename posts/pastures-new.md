I've been a freelance programmer since 2004. Like many contractors, I've
changed roles every 18 months to two years (the usual duration of a software
project from first steps to delivery). Often I took time off between
gigs to work on personal projects or learn something new. For instance, in 2008
I was a senior .NET developer for an investment bank in London, then took three
months off to embark on learning Python, only to reset my career and start
again as a junior Python coder soon after.

I've relished my freedom and independence, and it has been a privilege to work
on a huge variety of projects for a diverse range of companies in many
different sectors. I have been enriched by my colleagues, made many wonderful
friends, and learned a huge amount from folks. Thank you.

Upon my return from [Offa's Dyke](/article/offa-all/), I learned the CEO
of the health analytics company for whom I was contracting had been fired by
the board. Within 48 hours the new boss had decided to fire two thirds of the
workforce, including all engineers.

Ouch. At least it wasn't personal.

As a contractor I have a "parachute" fund for just such an occasion - although
I've never had to use it until now. Luckily for me, my contract was due to
finish at the end of May, and, since January, I had been in discussions about
the next interesting project.

I'm delighted to say I'll be joining [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) as
a principal engineer from the 21st June.

What is new is that I'll be an employee rather than freelancer. This is a
_very_ big change for me and my family.

A big factor in persuading me were the folks I met in interviews and the
company culture I encountered leading up to my offer of employment. Another
important factor was the nature of the work I'll be doing. I can't say any
more, but I'm very excited to work with a talented group of folks, on something
that I'll relish getting my teeth into. It will also allow me to bring together
and use skills from many different aspects of my background. Finally, Anaconda
understand what motivates folks passionate about code: I'll still be active as
an open source contributor and will continue to develop projects such as
[CodeGrades](https://codegrades.com/) in my own time, as has been the case so
far.

Here's to new adventures.
