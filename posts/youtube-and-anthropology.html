	<p>I spent an hour this evening watching the video below. I really enjoyed it because it explores the amazing potential that collaborative, networked and open medium offer. </p>

	<p>However, what I find most exciting is that we've only just scratched the surface of what and how such "mechanisms" can change.</p>

	<p>Oh yeah&#8230; two blog posts in the same day Nicholas! What is the world coming to..?</p>
