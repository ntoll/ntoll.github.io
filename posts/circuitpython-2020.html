<p>My buddy <a href="http://tannewt.org/">Scott</a>, one of the wonderful
people at <a href="https://adafruit.com/">Adafruit</a>, recently asked folks
in the wider CircuitPython community to
<a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/01/01/what-do-you-want-from-circuitpython-in-2020-circuitpython2020-circuitpython/">share their thoughts</a>
about what they'd like to see for the project and community during 2020. This
is my contribution to the conversation.</p>

<p>There are three aspects to my hopes for CircuitPython in 2020:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Things I hope will continue,</li>
    <li>Developments I hope to happen,</li>
    <li>"Moon on a stick" wishes for the future.</li>
</ol>

<p>I want to start by reaffirming my belief that Adafruit, and those
involved with CircuitPython in particular, do inspiring stuff when it
comes to fostering an open, welcoming, supportive and collaborative tech
community. This is an extraordinary achievement. My own experience in the
wider Python community is that it takes a huge amount of effort, patience,
compassion and thoughtfulness to grow and sustain such a
"<a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/06/scenius-or-comm/">scenius</a>"
(and, sadly, this can be destroyed very quickly by only a few bad actors). So
my wish for continuation in 2020 is that everyone involved in the
CircuitPython community grasp opportunities to enlarge positive aspects of
ourselves such as mutual appreciation, the sharing of tools and techniques,
latent network effects, and a spirit of tolerance, compassion and fun.</p>

<p>What I hope happens this year is a broadening of CircuitPython's horizons.
My passion for tech can be summed up by a quote from David Allen, the producer
on the original BBC micro from the 1980s -- my first computer. He
<a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/the-legacy-of-bbc-micro/">explained</a>
that, "[t]he aim was to democratise computing. We didn't want people to be
controlled by it, but to control it." CircuitPython feels to me like it sits
very much in the hobbyist / enthusiast "segment" of users who already know
something of programming. I'd love CircuitPython to make inroads into
beginner related education. This probably involves a focus on
learning what teachers would like from a coding platform, honest appraisals of
how beginner coders (no matter their age or background) find their first steps
with CircuitPython and Adafruit boards, as well as making the results of such
findings accessible to all. This final point is important. Learning to code
shouldn't just be an option for English speaking, able bodied folk from a
cultural background that means examples and cultural assumptions are
easily understood. I hope you agree that education should be an inclusive
endeavour, and this takes concerted and conscientious effort. I hope the
CircuitPython community find the time and space to invest in the (never
finished) work such a focus entails.</p>

<p>My "moon on a stick" is a CircuitPython based mobile phone with a touch
screen and a simple
(<a href="https://pypercard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PyperCard</a> like?)
Python UI that's easily hackable. Think
of it as the open, easy-to-assemble, relatively cheap and "hack friendly"
version of something like the
<a href="https://www.thelightphone.com/">Light Phone</a> with all the
schematics and design assets (e.g. files for 3d printing the case) available
under open source licenses so folks can go mod-crazy. Now wouldn't that
be a turn up for the books..?</p>

<p>I'll finish by wishing everyone in the CircuitPython a flourishing and
happy new year. Here's to wonderful things in 2020.</p>

<p>Let's go..!</p>
