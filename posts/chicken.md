A large part of my day job involves reading and writing what folks
optimistically call "technical documentation". It's usually about as much
fun as sticking forks in one's eyes, rubbing a cheese grater up and down one's
nose or reading the complete unabridged works of Ayn Rand.

Happily, there are examples of great technical documentation (the
[Django project](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/) immediately springs to
mind, and the wonderful folks at
[Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/) do amazing work in this
space). But for every example of great documentation, there are many more
incomprehensible, incomplete or incoherent tomes where knowledge goes to die.

Joking aside, quality is clearly a subjective judgement.

It's easy to make innocuous claims like, "good technical writing is clear,
coherent and engaging; bad documentation is the opposite ~ complicated, chaotic
and opaque". Yet trying to pin down terms like "clear" "coherent" or "engaging"
is a slippery exercise and, ultimately, a matter of personal taste.

A more nuanced approach would say diversity of voices and perspectives is
at play here, and _it's important to always keep this in mind_. Every reader
and writer comes to documentation from their own unique point of view and lived
experience. That's why pointing out examples of allegedly poor documentation or
claiming there is a "one true way" to write it is unhelpful. It's disrespectful
of difference, arrogantly presumptuous and there are more supportive and open
minded ways to engage when (inevitable) difficulties arise.

For instance, constructive, compassionate and clear feedback can highlight
unintended misunderstanding. It acknowledges there is a difficulty of some
sort, but does so in a way that encourages writers to reflect, refine and
revise their work. It's also perfectly reasonable for the writer to decline to
change things: perhaps you are not the intended audience, they simply don't
have the time (many docs written for open source projects are created by
volunteers), or they disagree with you and stand by their work.

Let many flowers bloom!

If I'm honest, I love to read (even stuff I find difficult or disagreeable ~
like Ayn Rand). It is a connection with others, a source of creative
stimulation and an enlargement of my world. I read because I am curious to
reach out beyond myself and into the lives of others. I love the change and
growth this brings. I also love to write - it is an opportunity for self
reflection, a source of consolation, an invitation to connect, and a rewarding
skill to develop and practice.

That's why I write this blog: I enjoy the art of writing.

The artistry involved in writing is something to celebrate,
cherish and promote. Sadly, and far too often, a focus on form, structure or
process is held up as the best approach to writing technical documentation.
Artistry, taste or style are hardly mentioned, if at all.

Most documentation looks like what most people think documentation should look
like. There are good reasons why documentation is often organised in the way
that it is, _but to follow these conventions is not enough_. Going through the
motions in a structural sense or following a certain form or process is no
guarantee of "quality" (whatever that might mean).

A wonderful and humorous example of this is Doug Zongker's "Chicken chicken
chicken".

Originally
[created in the form of an academic paper](https://isotropic.org/papers/chicken.pdf),
and then delivered in the form of a typical academic conference presentation,
Doug created two parodies that focus on process, form and structure at the
expense of meaningful content:

<div class="video-container">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yL_-1d9OSdk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

(I love how the audience all sound like chickens because they're laughing so
hard.)

Doug's work got me wondering, would the "chicken" effect work for the tropes
and conventions of a software project? I'm pleased to report
[that it does](https://chicken.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It even works
[for the source code](https://github.com/ntoll/chckn/blob/chicken/chicken.py),
[Git repository](https://github.com/ntoll/chckn) and the
[packaging metadata](https://pypi.org/project/chckn/) too.

The "chicken" code highlights what a deeply problematic oversight this
focus on form, structure and process is for technical documentation. Imagine
if teaching the composition of poetry only dealt with structure, rhyme
or rhythm at the expense of meaning, metaphor, story-telling, pacing, symbolism
and expression.

We'd end up with limericks like this:

<blockquote>
Chicken chicken chicken chicken,<br/>
Chicken chicken chicken chicken,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chicken chicken chick,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chicken chicken chick,<br/>
Chicken chicken chicken chicken.
</blockquote>

Why this interest in technical documentation?

I'm in the midst of a writing marathon for some of my personal
projects (Mu and CodeGrades). I'm really enjoying the opportunity to reflect
upon, and work both inside and outside, the usual conventions for technical
documentation. Process, form and structure are always the servants of
authentically expressing myself in my own unique writing voice. If I am
ever disatisfied with my output, it's usually because I've forgotten
this (and I just had to write this blog post to say so!).

As always with any of my work, I welcome constructive, compassionate and clear
feedback. :-)
