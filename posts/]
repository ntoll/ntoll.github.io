While
[studying at the Royal College of Music](/article/remembering-john/)
I realised two things: I wouldn't become a professional musician and making
sense of the universe is a deeply challenging, subtle and rewarding experience.
So, upon graduating I embarked on a philosophy degree. It was an exciting
time...  I had [just met Mary](/article/25-anniversary-plans/) and I was
acquiring a sense of the historic philosophical terrain while working out where
I found myself on the philosophical map.

A turning point was my first encounter with Heraclitus, who has remained a
constant philosophical companion throughout my life. This blog post briefly
explores why Heraclitus resonates so much with me.

What is probably true about Heraclitus can be said in a paragraph of four
sentences.

Heraclitus, son of Bloson (or Heracon), was born and lived
in [Ephesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephesus) - a Greek city on the
west coast of modern day Turkey. He was a member of an aristocratic family and
gave up his hereditary right of "kingship" to his brother. His
_acme_ (ancient Greek for "prime" - usually regarded as around the age of 40)
was considered by
[Apollodorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollodorus_of_Athens) to have
been the [69th Olympiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiad) (504â€“501 BC),
and he probably died approximately twenty years later. He wrote a single
philosophical work, well known in antiquity but now lost, which he left in
the [temple of Artemis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Artemis) at
Ephesus.

That's it!

However, many spurious claims have been made about Heraclitus; the main source
being [Diogenes Laertius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_Laertius)'s
book
[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/57342/57342-h/57342-h.htm),
written in the 3rd century CE, circa 700 years after Heraclitus. Diogenes is a
troubling figure because he's a cross between an unreliable and highly
speculative gossip columnist, an uncritical historical biographer and a
scatter-gun reporter of "facts" (often lacking context, evidence or relevance).

His account of Heraclitus is a corker of a hatchet job, worthy of any British
[red top](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_journalism#Red_tops) tabloid.

According to Diogenes, Heraclitus was an
[autodidact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism)
who claimed to know
everything, regarded everyone else as a moron (with a few notable exceptions),
and preferred to play games with children than engage with his fellow citizens.
Because of his unpopularity and misanthropic nature he was forced to leave
Ephesus and live on a vegetarian diet, alone in the mountains. Eventually he
fell victim to [dropsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema) and returned to
Ephesus where he sought treatment from the town's doctors by posing them
riddles. Unable to make sense of the riddles, the doctors failed to cure him.
Heraclitus took matters into his own hands and decided to cover himself in
bovine faeces in the hope the warmth of the fresh dung would dry out his
dropsy. This failed and he died at the age of sixty, after which his "bullshit"
encrusted body was devoured by a pack of stray dogs.

Nevertheless, Diogenes reports that
[Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates), no less, was a puckish fan:

> They say that [Euripides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euripides), giving
> him [Socrates] a work of Heraclitus to read, asked him what he thought of it,
> and he replied: "The part I understand is excellent, and so too is, I dare
> say, the part I do not understand; but it needs a Delian diver to get to the
> bottom of it".

(A Delian diver fishes for pearls.)

This is a good example of Heraclitus's reputation in antiquity as obscure,
cryptic and difficult to fathom.
[Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle) complained about
Heraclitus's ambiguous punctuation and style in his
[Rhetoric](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=aristot.+rh.+1407b)
(a treatise in the technique of argument), and Aristotle's student
[Theophrastus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophrastus) reported 
Heraclitus's book was disjointed and unfinished, attributing this to
Heraclitus's melancholic nature (resulting in Heraclitus's epithet "the weeping
philosopher").

But Aristotle missed a subtle aspect of Heraclitus's technique of argument (in
his own work on the technique of argument!). Heraclitus's enigmatic style is
not a result of grammatical failings nor foggy thinking. He knew what he
wanted to say, and _how he wanted to say it_. His prose is often a subtle
embodiment of his philosophy. In fact, Heraclitus hints at this when he says,

<blockquote>
<p>The Lord whose [oracle is at Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia)
neither declares nor conceals, but shows by sign.</p>
<p><cite>B93</cite></p>
</blockquote>

Heraclitus's technique neither declares nor conceals, but shows by sign. It
makes his readers actively engage in the analysis, comprehension and literary
appreciation of his words, as a vehicle to demonstrate his wider philosophical
point. To me this is more akin to reading poetry, perhaps because Heraclitus
was one of the first Greek prose writers and the basic conventions of prose
writing had not yet been established.
