	<p>I've just found a rather cool website called <a href="http://wordle.net">Wordle</a>.</p>

	<p>It allows you to enter text and it produces "beautiful word clouds" (to quote the website) &#8211; and I happen to agree with them. I used the text of <a href="http://ntoll.org/article/computational-creativity">my post on computational creativity and species counterpoint</a> to produce the following:</p>

	<p><a href="http://wordle.net/gallery/Composing_Species_Counterpoint_with_Genetic_Algorithms" title="Wordle: Composing Species Counterpoint with Genetic Algorithms"><img src="http://ntoll.org/static/images/54.jpg" alt="Composing Species Counterpoint with Genetic Algorithms"/></a></p>

	<p>(click the image to get the full word cloud from the Wordle site &#8211; Java required).</p>

	<p>You are able to change the colours, fonts and layouts to create some rather funky effects. It is also possible to import the tags from specific users on <a href="http://del.icio.us/">delicious</a>. Here's a picture of the results for my user (ntoll):</p>
