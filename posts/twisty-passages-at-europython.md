[EuroPython](https://ep2020.europython.eu/) took place last month and the
raw video footage of the talks has just been published online. EuroPython has
always been one of my favourite conferences and is a special place for me:
it's where I gave my first ever programming talk back in 2010. It's also one of
the most culturally cosmopolitan programming conferences and was the world's
first community organised Python programming conference. I always come away
feeling enriched by EuroPython.

Thanks, as always, to the volunteer organisers who work so hard to bring about
this remarkable event. Such thanks are especially well deserved in 2020 since
it was held online due to the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The potential for
technical mishaps and problems was huge, yet the friendly and supportive team
behind the conference ensured a slick and engaging event.

As always, there were many great talks with a particular highlight for me being
a fascinating explanation of building "artistic artefacts" (computer generated
pictures in the style of human painters) with
[Generative Adversarial Networks](https://ep2020.europython.eu/talks/BSeL2FG-painting-with-gans-challenges-and-technicalities-of-neural-style-transfer/).

However, I sorely missed the corridor track - when you walk around the physical
conference venue and bump into an old buddy, find yourself striking up a
conversation with a friendly co-attendee in the coffee queue, or join a huddle
of welcoming folks discussing something interesting. The corridor track is
where the community comes alive. I'll have more to say about this in a
moment...

I was delighted to make two contributions to this year's conference.

The first was a wonderful opportunity to bring some music to the conference. My
friend and EuroPython's own force of nature,
[Marc-Andr&eacute;](https://www.malemburg.com/marc-andre-lemburg) got in touch
to say that they were looking for musical contributions to a "jam session". I
have, on several occasions, inflicted my love of tubas on Marc-Andr&eacute; so
he knew I used to be a professional classical musician. I can only assume his 
[Germanic inclination for oompah-bands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJZObBSU7E)
was at the back of his mind when he reached out. I responded that tuba music is
"rather niche" at the best of times, let alone as part of a "jam session".
Nevertheless, I agreed to contribute something, "perhaps a piece of classical
piano music?" (since I'd been playing lots of piano during lock-down here in
the UK).

In the end, I went for some
[Brahms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Brahms) ~ an
[Intermezzo](https://www.mfiles.co.uk/scores/brahms-intermezzo-op118-no2.pdf)
written "as a token of friendship" for his friend, the concert pianist and
composer [Clara Schumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Schumann). It's
my musical token of friendship towards everyone at EuroPython.

I hope you like it.

My second contribution was
[a presentation](https://ep2020.europython.eu/talks/AGaSaW8-how-to-run-a-corridor-track-in-a-remote-conference-with-python/)
which you can [watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAsIhG_ZlG4&t=15467)
(EuroPython have disabled the embedding of their videos). The slides I
prepared, including the links to all the resources I mention
[can be found here](/static/presentations/textsmith_ep2020/index.html#/).

The presentation is an exploration of how one might recreate a remote corridor
track via the internet. I think it speaks for itself (honestly, go watch it, I
had a lot of fun preparing and presenting it).

The summary is that I feel deeply uncomfortable about the way friendships,
conversation and community are mediated in a technical context at this moment
in time. This is something we should be especially concerned about given how
much of our interactions have taken place online during these times of virus
related lock-down.

I offer a quick explanation of what I find so uncomfortable about the current
state of the art and look into the history of computing for other, more humane,
respectful (of users) and creative means of communication via computers.

Ultimately, I describe how I'm using Python to recreate a programmable
[MUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) (a multi-user, realtime text based
virtual world) based upon ideas first explored in the late 1970s and which I
encountered in both the 1980s (while at school) and in the mid-1990s (when I
was at university). Such creations were famous for their mazes of twisty
passages that players could explore and inhabit together.

If you've never heard of MUDs before, here's
[Richard Bartle](https://mud.co.uk/richard/) (one of the authors of the
original MUD and author of the
[bible for virtual worlds](https://mud.co.uk/dvw/)) describing an old
technology for talking directly to the imagination...

As always, I love feedback, comments and constructive criticism offered in good
faith. Assuming the lock-downs have eased, next year's EuroPython will be in
Dublin, Ã‰ire.

I love Ireland. Can't wait. See you at next year's EuroPython.
