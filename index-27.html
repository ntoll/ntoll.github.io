    <p>One of the stand-out collaborations of my career has been with my buddy
<a href="https://dpgeorge.net/">Damien George</a>. He's the creator of
<a href="https://micropython.org/">MicroPython</a> ~ a lean and efficient implementation
of the Python programming language optimised to run in constrained
environments. When Damien created MicroPython I think he imagined "constrained
environments" to mean microcontrollers - the small single chip computers
beloved of embedded systems engineers, Internet of Things enthusiasts and the
Maker community.</p>
<p>Little did he realise that MicroPython was an amazing fit for another computing
context: the browser.</p>
<p><img alt="MicroPython" src="images/MicroPython_Logo.jpg"></p>
<p>The browser is an interesting space in which to work because of its unique
combinations of constraints.</p>
<p>Firstly, everything needed to view a web page needs to be delivered over the
network. So, the smaller the asset to be delivered can be, the better.
MicroPython, when compressed for delivery to the browser is only around 170k in
size - smaller than most images you find on most websites.</p>
<p>Secondly, the browser is perhaps the world's most battle tested sand boxed
computing environment. By this I mean that web browsers encounter all sorts of
interesting, nefarious, ill-performing, badly written and otherwise shonky
code. Such code should be constrained into a virtual sandbox, so it can't do
any damage to the user's wider system. Because of the recent development of
<a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/">web assembly</a> (shortened to WASM ~ a sort of
virtual microprocessor working in the browser), code written in C can be
compiled to run in the browser. MicroPython is written in C and Damien and his
collaborators have worked together to create
<a href="https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/ports/webassembly">a port for web assembly</a>.</p>
<p>Third and finally, the browser makes available to the developer of websites a
JavaScript object called <code>globalThis</code>, through which all the other objects,
functions and data structures needed to
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">access the capabilities of the browser</a>
are made available. By constraining developers to a single means of interacting
with the browser, there is only one way to go about making things happen.
MicroPython compiled to WASM has access to the full capabilities of the
sandboxed browser thanks to some of Damien's recent work on a foreign function
interface (FFI) that interacts with the JavaScript based APIs and capabilities
defined by <code>globalThis</code>.</p>
<p>Given this context, what does MicroPython allow you to do?</p>
<p>From within MicroPython running in the browser, one simply imports the <code>js</code>
module (short for JavaScript). It's an object in MicroPython that acts as a
proxy for <code>globalThis</code> in the browser. It makes interacting with the browser
from MicroPython an absolute joy. It's worth pointing out that Damien's work is
based upon the <code>js</code> work done as part of the
<a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/">Pyodide project</a> (a version of the CPython
interpreter for the browser), so no matter the version of Python you use in the
browser, you access the browser's capabilities in exactly the same way.</p>
<p>But recently, there was a problem.</p>
<p>I was due to give a talk about <a href="https://pyscript.com/">PyScript</a> (a platform
for taking MicroPython and Pyodide and making them easy to use in the browser)
at <a href="https://europython.eu/">EuroPython</a> and I was putting together code
examples of ever increasing complexity to present as part of my talk. But I
kept hitting strange errors when using MicroPython. My colleague and
web-guru <a href="https://webreflection.medium.com/">Andrea</a> managed to isolate the
problem but had been unable to work out why it was happening. Put simply,
somewhere in MicroPython's FFI, at that point where JavaScript and MicroPython
were interacting, unwanted JavaScript objects were unexpectedly leaking into
the MicroPython world thus causing things to crash. Think of it as a JavaScript
shaped spanner in the MicroPython works.</p>
<p>This wasn't a good situation to find oneself in, a few days before presenting
at one of the Python world's largest and most prestigious conferences.</p>
<p>Damien and I decided to debug the problem, and we recorded ourselves doing so
because Andrea wasn't available at the time of our call. We figured that if he
could watch our debugging session, he might spot something we hadn't and
suggest a fix.</p>
<p>In any case, what followed was a lot of fun, and the video of the debugging
session is embedded below.</p>
<p>There are some things you need to know before you watch the video:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both Damien and I know JavaScript to a sufficient level to be
  "dangerous". We can get stuff done, but we're not guru level like Andrea.</li>
<li>Damien is an expert in C (the language used to implement MicroPython) and
  clearly knows his way around the MicroPython codebase including the FFI that
  kept crashing. I am familiar enough with C to be able to read it, but not
  very experienced at writing it, and I certainly don't know anything about the
  MicroPython internals, including the FFI.</li>
<li>We were using a collaboration technique called pair programming: where one
  developer (Damien) is the "pilot" with the other developer (me) acting as
  "co-pilot". As you'll see in the video, Damien was sharing his screen so I
  could see what he was looking at and he'd often describe things, processes or
  problems to me, only for me to confirm them, explain them back or ask
  questions as a way to help maintain focus. As the one most ignorant of the
  language and code-base, I was in a good position to play the beginner to
  Damien's expert, and ask for clarifications.</li>
<li>Our debugging involved taking very careful steps to investigate and change
  the code so the problem was (happily) eventually revealed, tested and fixed.
  As the Chinese proverb explains: when crossing a river, it's best to do so
  slowly and by feeling with one's toes.</li>
<li>Both of us were having a lot of fun in different ways. Damien was clearly
  fascinated by delving into the problem. I was enjoying Damien's virtuosic
  debugging performance, and found out some fun stuff as we went along.</li>
</ul>
<p>So grab your popcorn, and enjoy the show:</p>

    <p>In June I was contacted by a friend in the EuroPython community.</p>
<p>They were looking for articles about how to deal with rejection and what to do
when one's proposal for a conference talk wasn't accepted. Since they couldn't
find anything suitable, they asked ChatGPT for suggestions, and this is how it
responded:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/chat-gpt-not-accepted.png" title="Talk not accepted"></p>
<p>In an entirely predictable turn of events, <em>ChatGPT was wrong</em> (no such post
existed at that time), and so I puckishly proposed writing such a post. We
can't have ChatGPT telling lies can we?</p>
<p>This is it.</p>
<hr class="section_break">
<h3>What to do when your talk is not accepted</h3>

<p>It is a rare privilege to find oneself in a community who genuinely cherish and
support the participation of all. Such company guarantees we encounter folk
who are different to ourselves: an opportunity to learn from each other's
contrasting backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. It's why <em>diversity is a
precondition for growth</em>: our worlds are mutually enlarged by our differences.</p>
<p>But this isn't an easy journey.</p>
<p>It takes compassion, empathy and thoughtfulness to nurture a safe space where
such encounters take place. Participants - through their actions, attitudes and
attention - embody and live the inclusive and open minded ethos necessary for
such a precious situation. This is a complex relationship
between the individual participant's personal outlook and the collective
<em>esprit de corps</em> that emerges from the aggregate contributions and
interactions of many different individuals.</p>
<p>Here's the challenge: it's not enough for a group to say they're inclusive,
open-minded and whatnot... that's just empty virtue signalling. Merely
"going through the motions" is an ignorant and insidious sort of cultural cargo
cult ~ <em>communication at the expense of community</em>. It happens far too often,
and normalizing such behaviour actively diminishes the possibility of a
genuinely inclusive and open-minded space.</p>
<p>Rather, such a community spirit springs
from the <em>quality of the interactions between individual participants</em>.
Sometimes such interactions are unavoidably painful: as when a proposed
contribution to a community event is rejected by the organisers.</p>
<p>Yet it is at these moments when embodiment by individuals, and the emergent
community spirit, are so important.</p>
<p>This equally applies both to organisers and participants.</p>
<p>If you are an organiser of a community event, and have a call for proposals but
limited space, then you will inevitably reject (and therefore exclude) some of
the proposed contributions. If you believe in a diverse and inclusive culture
then this process may feel deeply uncomfortable and paradoxical.</p>
<p>But this is the puzzle you face, and (I'm sorry to say) there's no right
answer.</p>
<p>Actually, the notion that there <em>is an answer</em> to such a situation is, I
believe, deeply flawed. Rather, <em>how you choose to conduct yourself, pay
attention to the situation and engage with the unfolding events</em> will reveal
your community's spirit. I hope you make a conscious personal decision to
choose compassion, empathy and thoughtfulness over going through the motions of
a performative brain dead cultural cargo cult.</p>
<p>Alternatively for participants, it can be deeply upsetting if your contribution
to an event has been rejected. All sorts of complicated feelings may come up
(although some may just shrug and move on). I want to reassure you that it is
natural and understandable to feel sad, disappointed or upset by such
rejection. Lean into such feelings and give them the time and space they
deserve. The worst thing you can do is ignore them.</p>
<p>Most importantly, pay attention to what happens next.</p>
<p>If the organisers of the event embody an inclusive and empowering community
spirit, their interactions with you will be affirmative, compassionate and
supportive. If you engage in good faith, such organisers will likely welcome
feedback or suggestions. But please remember they're human beings too and they
may respectfully disagree with you. This is what it is to be in a
diverse community - you'll meet folk with different outlooks to your own.</p>
<p>It's an opportunity to learn!</p>
<p>As an exercise in self-understanding and growth, you may want to
explore why your proposal was rejected (if this hasn't already been
explained). Such feedback is best received in a spirit of constructive
collaboration. You'll either discover how
to improve your next proposal or come to see how the event in question isn't a
good fit for what you want to contribute.</p>
<p>If the former, reflect and refine for next time.</p>
<p>If the latter, your niche might be elsewhere, so keep exploring!</p>
<p>If the event organisers are simply going through the motions, you'll know to
avoid the event in future.</p>
<p>In any case, be you an organiser of or participant in community events,
best of luck. Just remember flouishing and fulfilling communities are all about the quality
of individual interactions, something over which you have direct control: <em>how
<strong>you</strong> choose to participate</em>.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>
