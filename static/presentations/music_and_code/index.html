            <p>How did my experience of the UK community make me feel?</p>
            <p><b>Crushed</b>: because a community that prides itself on being
            welcoming, inclusive and supportive, clearly wasn't and, as
            demonstrated by my inbox, still isn't.</p>
            <p><b>Humiliated</b>: much of this played out on social media. I'm
            a very shy and private person, despite who you think you see on
            stage at this moment. It is deeply wounding to be personally
            attacked.</p>
            <p><b>Despondent</b>: 2018 was a tipping point, and since then,
            for the sake of my mental health, I have had no contact with the
            "formal" UK Python community or PyCon UK.</p>
            <p>For what it's worth, I hope people in the UK Python community
            never treat one of their own like this ever again.</p>

            <p>Why is this so important..?</p>
            <p>Code isn't written for computers, in
            the same way music isn't written for instruments.</p>
            <p>We write code because we are human beings, imbued with ideas,
            imagination and feelings. Code expresses our thoughts made digital:
            a medium for our values, cultures and ways of life.</p>
            <p>In other words, we are expressing ourselves when we write
            code. Our code reflects who we are. It reflects where we come from.
            It reflects how we want to be in the world.</p>
            <p>If there's one thing I hope we coders learn from the best
            of the musical world, it's compassion, tolerance and respect for
            freedom of expression in all the ways music represents.</p>

            <p>In a recent interview the Chinese American cellist Yo Yo Ma,
            explains,</p>
            <p>"The job of a musician is to transcend technique in order to
            express something of value. We explore lots of different music
            through our instruments and we love it because it allows us to
            encounter different states of mind."</p>
            <p>As developers, as we write code, we're trying to express
            something of value. We're exploring and interacting with our world
            through code and the applications we write.</p>
            <p>But what does he mean by transcending technique?</p>

            <p>At the start we examined lots of different skills, aspects of
            knowledge and ways to pay attention to the world. The sorts of
            things we learn about when we become musicians or coders.</p>
            <p>I think these are what YoYo Ma means by techniques to be
            transcended.</p>
            <p>When we express ourselves, we take all this stuff, assemble it,
            refine it, fix it, break it and play around with it...</p>
            <p>In so doing, we also put something of ourselves into the thing
            we're making.</p>
            <p>Only when we feel safe and secure do we send it into the world
            so others experience it.</p>
            <p>I get to encounter a little bit of you in this thing you have
            created, and my world is made larger as a result.</p>

            <p>While I play, consider the ways in which you may
