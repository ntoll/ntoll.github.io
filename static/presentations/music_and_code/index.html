            <p>I'm Nicholas, I'm based in the UK and work as a principal
            engineer at Anaconda, where I'm a member of the wonderful PyScript
            team.</p>
            <p>But this is going to be a very personal talk, and nothing to do
            with my day job.</p>
            <p>In this talk, I'm going to use music as a metaphor, a contrast
            and a foil to coding. It's an opportunity to explore, re-evaluate
            and re-encounter coding from an unusual and hopefully stimulating
            perspective. I'll be paying particular attention to teaching,
            learning and the place of software within our culture. I hope you
            enjoy it and find it interesting.</p>
            <p>But before embarking, I want to learn a bit about you.</p>

          <h2>You..?</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Any musicians in the audience? I must apologise in advance for
            my piano playing.</p>
            <p>I'm really an orchestral tuba player and piano is very much my
            second study. For non-musicians, what I've just said is something
            along the lines of, as Python is to my tuba playing, so copy and
            pasting JavaScript from StackOverflow is to my piano playing. Thus
            demonstrating the power of analogy and metaphor to reveal
            interesting insights about the world. I'll be doing a lot of that
            during this talk.</p>
            <p>Any students or teachers here?</p>
            <p>I hoped you'd all put your hand up. A wonderful yet challenging
            aspect of our work as engineers is that we're always learning new
            technology. We're lifelong students. Inevitably, if you write code,
            you'll also write documentation, explain code for review or to
            colleagues, give talks at conferences like this one or support
            collaborators or users of your application. A core part of being
            an engineer is to explain yourself, and that means you're a
            teacher. Pedagogy, the skill of mentoring and supporting learning,
            is an essential aspect of what it is to be an effective
            engineer.</p>

          <h1>Part 1.<br/>The Knowledge</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>With the scene suitably set, let's start by exploring different
            types of skill, knowledge and ways to pay attention to the world.
            These are, after all, the sorts of things we need to learn about in
            order to do meaningful stuff.</p>
            <p>We start with a musical example.</p>

          <h2>Nature</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>There are many elements that make up music and one of the more
            important is the concept of pitch. How do we know what pitches to
            play? We use the naturally occuring harmonic series in a circular
            process that give us our 12 note scale. Pythagoras is,
            traditionally, said to have discovered these relationships.
            Instruments are then tuned - their physical characteristics are
            changed - so they play the notes arrived at via these mathematical
            relationships.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>In computing, an equivalent might be to describe the mechanical
            processes of a Turing machine as a way to define a computer.</p>
            <p>The repeated steps of reading a symbol from a tape and looking
            up a machine's numbered state, to discover a next step that defines
            updating or ignoring the symbol at the current position on the
            tape, transitioning to a new machine state and moving the tape one
            way or another is, unambiguously, the foundations of computing.</p>
            <p>What's important, is we are describing aspects of and processes
            relating to a purely physical view of the world. Yet our world is
            so much richer than just such a view because we can't help but
            give meaning to those aspects of the physical world we've just been
            exploring.</p>

          <h2>Meaning</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>What do I mean?</p>
            <p>In music we group pitches into keys, we describe the
            relationship between pitches with "intervals" and such intervals
            are categorised as either consonant or dissonant.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>In computing sequences of bits are used to represent things. We
            even have to agree on the "endian-ness" to make sure we get the
            order of bits the right way round when reading or writing memory,
            eating eggs, or transmitting data via a network. You don't need me
            to tell you the on/off state of bits is used to represent binary
            numbers, which themselves represent other things... such as
            characters in a string of text.</p>

&gt;&gt;&gt; chr(65)
'A'
&gt;&gt;&gt; bin(65)
'0b1000001'</code></pre>
           <p>Keys, consonance or dissonance, endianness or that the number 65
           represents the character "A" are not true facts in a scientific
           sense: they are meaningful concepts that map onto the physical world
           in some way, but most definitely are the result of the designs,
           choices or traditions of humans. Philosophers would describe them as
           socially constructed facts rather than "laws of nature".</p>

          <h2>Abstraction</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Not only do we ascribe meaning to things, but we combine and
            build with such relationships to create more complicated things. In
            other words, we make use of abstraction.</p>
            <p>Here's a couple of musical abstractions:</p>
            <p>If melody is pitches of a certain duration ordered through time,
            then harmony concerns pitches played together at the same time.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section data-background-image="img/melody_harmony.png">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>In other words, melody is the X axis, harmony is the Y.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section data-background-image="img/hymn.png">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The intervals we encountered earlier allow us to build chords
            (that is, notes played together as a harmony) in a certain key and
            the consonance / dissonance categories allow us to resolve chords
            into one another.</p>
            <p>The notion of chords and harmonic resolution depends on the
            lower level concepts of pitch, keys and intervals.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Similarly, the way we ascribed numbers to characters allows us
            to make groups of such numbers that represent strings of textual
            information... for example, Python code that has a certain formal
            syntax that allows us to combine meaningful abstractions.</p>

          <h2>Art(efacts)</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Such abstractions, when sufficiently powerful, allow us to
            express ourselves, create cultural artefacts that influence and
            interact with people.</p>

              <li>Texture - how the notes are arranged together give a feeling
              of distance: either squashed together or spaced wide apart.</li>

            <p>Ten years ago it was all the rage to "inspire" kids with the

            <p>I believe this is a very narrow-minded, simplistic and not
            particularly helpful way to encourage folks to code. In fact it's
            quite mercenary and frames the value of code in terms of

            <p>I hope we can all agree, a more enlightened and nuanced view
            promotes a deeper and more subtle view of coding as an art or
            rewarding skill practiced by all sorts of interesting people (not
            just billionaires) that allows you to make cool things, rather than
            how much money you can make from it.</p>

            knowledge and ways to pay attention to and interact with the
            world.</p>
            <p>Anyone who claims learning music is simply limited to acquiring
            the ability to read notes, is just as ignorant as someone claiming
            that learning coding merely involves learning what a "while" loop
            is.</p>
            <p>Clearly, the world, and us humans who inhabit it, is a

            <p> It turns out that, given such a rich, deep and complex

            a long term investment of time and effort to acquire a set of

            <p>My tuba mentor at Octubafest suggested a few books to read, so
            I started with this one since it promised to get me up to speed
            really quickly.</p>

            <p>But that book didn't really work for me, so I bought this one
            instead. At over 800 pages I was certain I'd be able to learn
            everything I needed to play the tuba.</p>
            <p>But I have to admit, I tried reading this book, but I couldn't
            really connect with the material. It felt too complicated and I
            even started to doubt the tuba was for me.</p>
            <p>I have to admit, that's when I started watching videos about
            an alternative, more light-weight musical instrument framework
            called "the recorder".</p>

            <p>It soon became apparent that my calling was for the bass end of
            things so I soon abandoned the recorder, which was a lot more
            difficult to play than I at first imagined.</p>
            <p>A friend knew someone who was an actual musician with a degree
            in music theory, and they suggested I look into the technical
            details of music.</p>
            <p>Apparently, in actual real-life music auditions you have to
            solve harmony problems on a white board, so this seemed like a
            really good idea.</p>
            <p>So I found a series of two minute videos about music
            theory.</p>

            <p>Music theory makes quantum mechanics look like an episode of

            <p>It was then I spotted a poster on the London underground for a
            bootcamp. If I handed over several thousand of pounds, and lived
            off my savings for three months, the bootcamp would teach me
            everything I needed to know.</p>
            <p>They even told me they had an 80% success rate at placing

              <li>How to read musical notes.</li>

            <p>I imagine many of us own SAMS 24h and O'Reilly books. Octubafest
            is a real thing, totally awesome and run by the effervescent Rachel
            Coles. Sarah Jeffery's "Team Recorder" channel and  Jesse
            Strickland's "Two Minute Music Theory" channel are wonderful
            examples of two formidably talented musicians who mentor through a
            digital medium. Yet none of these folks would claim their resources
            should replace a conventional music education. Rather, they
            complement one.</p>
            <p>I wanted to show you how all the sorts of things we do in coding
            education; the books, Django Girls, beginner coding videos and
            computer science channels appear to non-programmers.</p>
            <p>Many conscientious, passionate and generous hearted people in
            our community give up their time and put a huge amount of effort
            to make many wonderful educational resources and events.</p>
            <p>But something doesn't quite feel right to me...</p>
            <p>The epitome is in the the bootcamp slide. It's of an actual
            London based boot camp's website with references to code replaced 
            by references to equivaent musical terms. I have to ask, would you
            hire a band of musicians to play at your wedding, funeral, bar
            mitzvah if you knew they were recent graduates of a three month
            music boot camp? In a sense, we're setting up folks to encounter
            very uncomfortable situations, and over the past two years several
            investigative journalists have examined and found serious problems
            with the claims of such courses. A good place to start would be
            Business Insider's piece from last year.</p>

            <p>I think my unease is with the speed at which we seem to think
            folks will learn coding, and that we provide didactic, expert led,
            courses, books and videos. We even use euphemisms like "zero to
            thirty", as if we're in some sort of a grand prix. I think this is
            unfair to beginner coders,
            naive at best, and morally suspect at worse. We're simply not
            being truthful about the amount of time, work, effort and, let's be
            honest here, frustration, it takes to even start to come to terms
            with coding in any meaningful way.</p>

            <p>In 2011, John Pinner asked me to look into starting an education
            track at PyConUK. John was also a musical connoisseur and we used
            Music For Youth as one of our north stars, when putting together
            the very first kids day in 2012.</p>
            <p>Asking what sort of education and learning our community
            supports is how we decide what sort of community we become.</p>
            <p>For it is through education and learning that we engage with our
            future colleagues, friends and supporters.</p>
            <p>Education isn't just explaining stuff. As educators, it is
            encumbant on us to embody the sort of behaviour, attitude, skill
            and knowledge we hope to inspire in our students.</p>
            <p>This is a long, slow and at times frustrating journey. But it's
            a journey made possible because mentors, teachers, guides and
            other helpers step up and encourage learners on their own journey
            to experience. By taking steps on this journey learners encounter
            and practice what it is to be a Python coder in an inclusive,
            supportive and diverse community.</p>
            <p>Between 2013-2015, each year, we welcomed 50 teachers and
            over 100 kids to our conference, to take their first steps.</p>
            <p>I'm proud to say, we encountered many moments like these three
            young coders, autonomously debugging a Python script running
            something crazy in Minecraft.</p>

            <p>I want to be very clear: the UK Python community and PyCon UK is

            <p>Furthermore, I think it unhelpful to ignore folks who have
            encountered problems in our community. I believe we should
            acknowledge that not everyone has a wonderful time in the Python
            community. If we delete such things, we ignore problems, and
            that can't lead anywhere good. It also means we're not embodying
            what it is to be a welcoming, inclusive, tolerant and supportive
            community.</p>

            yourself then we
            extinguish any possibility of you becoming fully a part of the

            curtailed, your unique gifts are cast aside and you have no way to

            code.</p>
            <p>The word "express" means to manifest or make known. When we
            write code we express our vision of what a digital world should
            look like or behave. It reflects who we are. It reflects where we
            come from. It reflects how we want to be in the world.</p>

            <p>A last musical metaphor...</p>
            <p>In a recent interview with Chinese American cellist
            explains,</p>
            <p>"The job of a musician is to transcend technique in order to
            express something of value. We explore lots of different music
            through our instruments and we love it because it allows us to
            encounter different states of mind."</p>
            <p>As developers, as we write code, we're trying to express
            something of value. We're exploring and interacting with our world
            through code and the applications we write.</p>
            <p>But what does he mean by transcend technique?</p>
            <p>At the start we examined lots of different aspects of knowledge
            and paying attention to the world. The sorts of things we learn
            about when we become musicians or coders.</p>
            <p>We talked about the physics that tunes this instrument,
            the organisation of notes, some of which are consonant or
            dissonant, how the context of chords gives us harmony, how
            arpeggio, tempo, dynamics and rubato are used to make a piece
            sound interesting. These are techniques, just like those I also
            mentioned relating to coding.</p>
            <p>When we express ourselves, we take all this stuff, assemble it,
            refine it, fix it, break it and play around with it... but in the
            end, and if we're in a safe place, we send it into the world so
            others can make sense of it.</p>

            <p>All the things that are fundamental, all the things that, to the
