            <p>I'm Nicholas. I'm a principal engineer at Anaconda, working in
            the PyScript team.</p>
            <p>This is going to be a personal talk, and nothing to do with my
            day job.</p>
            <p>I'm going to use music as a <b>metaphor, a contrast
            and a foil to coding</b>. It's an opportunity to
            <b>explore, re-evaluate and re-encounter</b> coding from an unusua
            l and hopefully stimulating perspective. I'll be paying particular
            attention to teaching, learning and the place of software within
            our culture. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
            <p>But first, I want to learn about you.</p>

          <h2>You..?</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Any musicians in the audience? I must apologise in advance for
            my piano playing.</p>
            <p>I'm really an orchestral tuba player and piano is very much my
            second study. For non-musicians, what I've just said is something
            along the lines of, <b>as Python is to my tuba playing, so copy and
            pasting JavaScript from StackOverflow is to my piano playing</b>.
            Thus demonstrating the power of analogy and metaphor to reveal
            interesting insights about the world. I'll be doing a lot of that
            during this talk.</p>
            <p>Any students or teachers here? I hoped you'd all put up your
            hands.</p>
            <p>A wonderful yet challenging
            aspect of our work as engineers is that we're always learning new
            technology. We're lifelong students. Inevitably, if you write code,
            you'll also write documentation, explain code for review or to
            colleagues, give talks at conferences like this one or support
            collaborators or users of your application. A core part of being
            an engineer is to explain yourself, and that means you're a
            teacher. Pedagogy, the skill of mentoring and supporting learning,
            is an essential aspect of what it is to be an effective
            engineer.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>With the scene suitably set, let's start by exploring different
            types of skill, knowledge and ways in which we pay attention to the
            world. These are, after all, the sorts of things we need to
            cultivate and understand in order to do meaningful things
            together.</p>
            <p>We start with a musical example.</p>

          <h2>Nature</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>There are many elements that make up music and one of the more
            important is the concept of pitch. How do we know what pitches to
            play? We use the naturally occuring harmonic series in a circular
            process that give us our 12 note scale. Pythagoras is,
            traditionally, said to have discovered these relationships.
            Instruments are then tuned - their physical characteristics are
            changed - so they play the notes arrived at via these mathematical
            relationships.</p>

            <p>In computing, an equivalent might be to describe the mechanical
            processes of a Turing machine as a way to define a computer.</p>
            <p>The repetition of reading symbols from a tape and looking up a
            state, only to modify the tape, move it and transition to a new
            state, is, unambiguously, the mechanical foundation of what it is
            to be a computer.</p>
            <p>What's interesting is I'm describing aspects of and processes
            relating to a purely physical view of the world.</p>
            <p>Yet our world is a much richer place, because we can't help but
            ascribe meaning to those aspects of the physical world we've just
            been exploring.</p>

          <h2>Meaning</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>What do I mean?</p>
            <p>In music we group pitches into keys, we describe the
            relationship between pitches with "intervals" and such intervals
            are categorised as either consonant or dissonant.</p>
            <p>SINGING</p>
            <p>In computing sequences of bits are used to represent things. We
            even have to agree on the "endian-ness" to make sure we get the
            order of bits the right way round when reading or writing memory,
            eating eggs, or transmitting data via a network. You don't need me
            to tell you the on/off state of bits is used to represent binary
            numbers, which themselves represent other things... such as
            characters in a string of text.</p>

           <p>Keys, consonance or dissonance, endianness or that the number 65
           represents the character "A" are not true facts in a scientific
           sense: they are meaningful concepts that map onto the physical world
           in some way, but most definitely are the result of the designs,
           choices or traditions of humans. Philosophers would describe them as
           socially constructed facts rather than "laws of nature".</p>

          <h2>Abstraction</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Not only do we ascribe meaning to things, but we combine and
            build with such relationships to create more complicated things. In
            other words, we make use of abstraction.</p>
            <p>Here's a couple of musical abstractions:</p>
            <p>If melody is pitches of a certain duration ordered through time,
            then harmony concerns pitches played together at the same time.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section data-background-image="img/melody_harmony.png">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>In other words, melody is the X axis, harmony is the Y.</p>

        <section data-background-image="img/hymn.png">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The intervals we encountered earlier allow us to build chords
            (that is, notes played together as a harmony) in a certain key and
            the consonance / dissonance categories allow us to resolve chords
            into one another.</p>
            <p>The notion of chords and harmonic resolution depends on the
            lower level concepts of pitch, keys and intervals.</p>
            <p>There's a sort of knowledge dependency tree emerging...</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Similarly, the way we map numbers to characters allows us
            to group such numbers together to build strings of textual
            information... for example, Python code that has a certain formal
            syntax that allows us to combine meaningful abstractions.</p>
            <p>Just as with music, the notion of strings, and code expressed
            using a certain syntax depends upon the lower level concepts of
            binary numbers representing characters, with binary numbers
            mapped to physical characteristics of the hardware.</p>

            <p>Such abstractions, when sufficiently powerful, allow us to
            express ourselves, create cultural artefacts that influence and

            <p>For example, remember that hymn like example from just a moment

            called Johann Sebastian Bach.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Chords become broken chords - feeling of movement and
              flow.</li>
              <li>Texture - how the notes are arranged together give a feeling
              of distance: either squashed together or spaced wide apart.</li>
              <li>Rubato, articulation, dynamics, phrasing: Used to create a

            <p>This piece of music is brought into the world by the imagination

            <p>Ten years ago it was all the rage to "inspire" kids with all
            the money that could be made writing code.</p>
            <p>Personally, I believe this is not a particularly helpful way to
            encourage folks to learn to code. In fact it's quite mercenary and
            frames what we do only in terms of financial or economic
            worth...</p>
            <p>To paraphrase Oscar Wilde: we're aware of the price of code, but
            not of its intrinsic value.</p>

              <li>Ada Lovelace - the world's first computer programmer.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>I hope we can all agree, a more nuanced perspective promotes
            code as a creative act and rewarding skill practiced by all sorts
            of interesting people (not just billionaires). Code allows you to
            make cool things that reflect your world and tell your story,
            rather than just make shed loads of money (although that is also
            possible).</p>

            <p>We've only briefly explored the many different aspects, skills,
            knowledge and ways to pay attention to and interact with the
            world.</p>
            <p>Anyone who claims learning music is simply limited to acquiring
            the ability to read notes, is just as ignorant as someone claiming
            that learning to code merely involves understanding a programming
            language's syntax and core constructs.</p>
            <p>Clearly, the world is a complicated place. As are us humans who
            inhabit it.</p>
            <p>It turns out that, given such a rich, deep and complex
            situation, learning anything to any degree of competence requires
            a long term investment of time and effort to acquire a set of
            skills, theory, knowledge and experience. These have to be

            called Rachel. The aim of Octubafest is to inspire folks to fall
            in love with a full stack instrumental framework called tubas.</p>
            <p>Octubafest organize free tuba workshops, create
            online tuba tutorials and curate amazing first experiences with
            sousaphones.</p>

            <p>My tuba mentor at Octubafest suggested a few books to read, so
            I started with this one since it promised to get me up to speed
            really quickly.</p>
            <p>But that book didn't really work for me...</p>

            <p>...so I bought this one
            instead. At over 900 pages I was certain I'd be able to learn
            everything I needed to play the tuba.</p>
            <p>But I couldn't connect with the rather advanced and
            complicated technical material. I even started to doubt the tuba
            was for me.</p>
            <p>I have to admit, that's when I started watching videos about
            an alternative, more light-weight musical instrument framework
            called "the recorder".</p>

            <p>It soon became apparent that my calling was for the bass end of
            things and I soon abandoned the recorder. It turns out that,
            despite being so small and lightweight, the recorder is a lot more
            difficult to play than I at first imagined.</p>
            <p>A friend knew someone who was an actual musician with a degree
            in music theory, and they suggested I look into the technical
            details of music.</p>
            <p>Apparently, in actual real-life music auditions you have to
            solve harmony problems on a white board, and investigating music
            theory seemed like a really good idea.</p>
            <p>So I found a series of bite-sized two minute videos about music
            theory.</p>

            <p>It was then I spotted a poster on the London underground for a
            bootcamp. If I handed over several thousand pounds, and lived
            off my savings for three months, the bootcamp would teach me
            everything I needed to know.</p>
            <p>They even told me they had an 80% success rate at placing

            <p>I learned about all sorts of things I never encountered in the
            books or video courses:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>How to read musical notes.</li>
              <li>How to use my tuba to play the core seven notes all classical
              musicians use.</li>
              <li>How to wear a tuxedo for an orchestra concert.</li>
              <li>Turning the pages of the score without making them
              rustle in the quiet bits.</li>
              <li>Bowing during applause.</li>
              <li>The tutors even flagged advanced concepts like key
              signatures and time signatures, but said we'd pick them up
              better, once we'd found our first role.</li> 
            </ul>
            <p>Out of the cohort of 50 who started the course, only 5 of us
            actually graduated, and of those, 4 of us (80%) do have jobs
            relating to music. I work in a record shop, another is a music
            librarian, and two others got gigs as studio technicians, although
            they tell me they're not allowed to touch any of the

            <p>Joking aside...</p>
            <p>I imagine many of us own SAMS 24h and O'Reilly books. Octubafest
            is a real thing, totally awesome and run by the wonderful Rachel
            Coles. Sarah Jeffery's "Team Recorder" channel and Jesse
            Strickland's "Two Minute Music Theory" channel are wonderful
            examples of two formidably talented musicians who mentor through a
            digital medium.</p>
            <p>I wanted to show you how all the sorts of things we do in coding
            education; the books, Django Girls, beginner coding videos and
            computer science channels appear to non-programmers.</p>
            <p>Many conscientious, passionate and generous hearted people in
            our community give up their time and put a huge amount of effort
            into making many wonderful educational resources and events.</p>
            <p>But something doesn't quite feel right to me...</p>
            <p>The epitome is in the the bootcamp slide. It's of an actual
            London based boot camp's website with references to code replaced 
            by references to equivalent musical terms. I have to ask, would you
            hire a band of musicians to play at your wedding, funeral, bar
            mitzvah if you knew they were recent graduates of a three month
            music boot camp? In a sense, such schemes are playing a dangerous
            game: setting up folks to encounter very uncomfortable situations
            as they quickly swim out of their technical depth. Furthermore,
            over the past two years several investigative journalists have
            examined and found serious problems with the claims of some of the
            more popular bootcamps. A good place to start would be Business
            Insider's piece from last year.</p>

            <p>I think my unease is with the speed at which we seem to think
            folks will learn coding, and that we provide didactic, expert led,
            courses, books and videos. We even use euphemisms like "zero to
            thirty", as if we're in some sort of a grand prix. I think this is
            unfair to beginner coders,
            naive at best, and morally suspect at worse. We're simply not
            being truthful about the amount of time, work, effort and, let's be
            honest here, frustration, it takes to even start to come to terms
            with coding in any meaningful way.</p>
            <p>And we've not even touched upon the exploratory, imaginative
            and creative aspects of coding.</p>

            <p>To nurture such mutual growth, I hope our community is a place
            of learning, understanding and sharing. I hope our community is a
            place to affirm tolerance and compassion. I hope our community is
            a place for collaboratove creativity.</p>
            <p>All the diverse aspects of ourselves we choose to bring to
            this community should be welcomed. Reciprocate! Welcome, embrace
            and learn from others (even in the face of apparent
            misunderstanding).</p>
            <p>To act against this spirit invites ostracism... a loss that
            diminishes us all.</p>

            <p>If our community is not a safe space it extinguishes any
            possibility of folks becoming fully a part of the community. In so
            doing we are all diminished: contributions are curtailed,
            individual's unique gifts are cast aside and there is no way to
            fully become yourself as a member of the community.</p>
            <p>Why is this so important?</p>
            <p>Code isn't written for computers, in the same way music isn't
            written for instruments.</p>
            <p>We write code because we are human beings, imbued with ideas,
            imagination and feelings. Code expresses our thoughts made digital:
            a medium for our values, cultures and ways of life.</p>
            <p>In other words, we are expressing ourselves when we write
            code.</p>
            <p>Our code reflects who we are. It reflects where we
            come from. It reflects how we want to be in the world.</p>

            <p>A last musical metaphor...</p>
            <p>In a recent interview with Chinese American cellist Yo Yo Ma,
            he explains,</p>
            <p>"The job of a musician is to transcend technique in order to
            express something of value. We explore lots of different music
            through our instruments and we love it because it allows us to
            encounter different states of mind."</p>
            <p>As developers, as we write code, we're trying to express
            something of value. We're exploring and interacting with our world
            through code and the applications we write.</p>
            <p>But what does he mean by transcending technique?</p>

            <q>All the things that are fundamental, all the things that, to the
            human spirit, are most profoundly significant, can only be
            experienced, not expressed.</q><br/><br/> ~ Aldous Huxley
          </blockquote>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>At the start we examined lots of different aspects of knowledge
            and ways to pay attention to the world. The sorts of things we 
            learn about when we become musicians or coders.</p>
            <p>We talked about the physics that tunes this instrument,
            the organisation of notes, some of which are consonant or
            dissonant, how the context of chords gives us harmony, how
            arpeggio, tempo, dynamics and rubato are used to make a piece
            sound interesting, that our cultural context influences how we
            make sense of these cues.<p>
            <p>These are what YoYo Ma means by technique, just like those
            aspects of computing we also explored.</p>
            <p>When we express ourselves, we take all this stuff, assemble it,
            refine it, fix it, break it and play around with it... but in the
            end, and only if we're in a safe place, we send it into the world
            so others can experience it. I get to encounter a little bit of
            you in this thing you have created, and my world is made
            larger as a result.</p>
