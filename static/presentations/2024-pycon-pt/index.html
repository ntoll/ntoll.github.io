            <p>This is Edsger Dijkstra - one of the founders of computer
            science</p>
            <p>Dijkstra said programming was, "a practical exercise in the
            effective exploitation of one‚Äôs powers of abstraction".</p>
            <p>Abstraction is the means by which we model the world we
            encounter.</p>
            <p>The world we encounter depends upon how we pay attention to
            it.</p>
            <p>In the world of programming, it turns out that paying attention
            to "paying attention" is worthy of paying attention.</p>

            <p>I'm more with Soren Kierkegaard on this: life is not a problem
            to solve but a reality to experience.</p>

            <p>I have a mokka pot, and have had one for years.</p>
            <p>It is part of the ceremony of my morning routine. There is
            something rather wonderful in making coffee with a Mokka, the
            simplicity, the smell, the great tasting coffee.</p>
            <p>I guess it's not that great if you're in a hurry though (but
            why hurry a coffee?).</p>

            <p>I guess it has one advantage: convenience.</p>
            <p>However, it has multiple disadvantages: that it tastes like
            dishwater being perhaps the most important.</p>

            <p>But what about the ceremony of coffee making?</p>
            <p>Also, this is about as much fun as writing YAML to configure

          <p>It is very easy to be blinded to the essential useless-ness
          of [their products] by the sense of achievement you get from getting
          them to work at all. In other words &mdash; and this is the rock
          solid principle on which the whole of the Corporation's Galaxy-wide
          success is founded &mdash; <em>their fundamental design flaws are

            <p>My story of the coffee machine (this is personal).</p>
            <p>Nobody asked if it was a good idea to create a technical
            solution to the "problem" of making coffee... there likely isn't
            a problem. Rather, folks feel so relieved the damn machine makes
            them a coffee that they forget they probably don't need the
            machine in the first place.</p>
            <p>Reminds me of the urban myth about the zero-G writing tool
            developed at a cost of millions of dollars by NASA. The Russians
            just used a pencil.</p>

          <h2>"Best practices"</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Finally we come to "best practices" who promise: if you pay
            attention to the things we tell you, everything will be OK.</p>
            <p>Right now, the use of AI is being promoted as a "best practice"
            in coding. But let's just remember that AI is just an acronym for
            PR.</p>

            <p>AI was bound to make an appearance at some point. You can't
            help but be amazed by some of the amazing results it produces.</p>
            <p>What I find interesting is how we pay attention to the outputs
            from AI.</p>
            <p>I'm also delightfully amazed at the way in which AI 
            misdirects its attention... often with comic or unfortunate side
            effects.</p>
            <p>Explain Tufts quality of questions research findings.</p>
            <p>Perhaps taking advice from an AI is not "best practice"?</p>
            <p>But where does such "best practice" come from?</p>

            <p>Beware people who offer themselves as gurus, who
            promote a "system" or offer pithy "best practices".</p>
            <p>Paying attention to them can often be detrimental simply
            because you cede responsibility for thinking for yourself. This
            is also perhaps true when paying attention to AI..? The computer
            says so in such a convincing manner, so it must be right.</p>
              <p>Here's the thing about such "best practices": they're often
              really stupid and rely on the inherent intelligence and
              humanity of participants to ensure they're meaningful.</p>
              <p>Just look at the poor reputation "Agile" methodology has
              these days, as rules, processes and "best practices" are
              enforced at the expense of, you know, actually intelligent,
              insightful or compassionate ways of working.</p>
              <p>Such tropes are often satirised... perhaps the most famous
              one in terms of developers, being Doug Zonkger's "Chicken".</p>

              <p>In the early 2000s, Doug wrote an academic paper that
              followed all the guidelines, conventions and best practices of
              a computer science report. But it only contains the word
              "chicken"</p>

              <p>It can be found on YouTube.</p>
              <p>Of course, we Python coders are far beyond being sent up
              for our own coding practices, right?</p>

            <p>It's not that technology is intrinsically bad.</p>
            <p>Rather, the way we pay attention to it is often thoughtless,
            shallow and ill-judged.</p>
            <p>I suspect a large part of the problem is the ceding of
            personal autonomy, freedom to express oneself, and control of
            one's "stuff" to machines or processes.</p>
            <p>There are many different ways to pay attention to the world,
            and by focusing on the whole or parts thereof, each illuminates
            the other depending on the sort of attention we pay to it. The
            world is independent of us, yet how we pay attention to the world
            reveals the world to us in a certain sort of way. Such creative
            attention is a potent and fluid process of encountering,
            understanding and expressing. We discern the universe and also
            change the universe through our discerning and reacting to it. How
            we choose to pay attention (for it is certainly a choice), is a
            significant creative and moral act: it both makes and enlarges
            the world.</p>
            <p>Often we make this difficult, as we forget to pay attention to
            the way we're paying attention to ourselves, each other and what's
            going on out in the universe.</p>

              <p>An inevitable musical metaphor illustrates what I mean. As a
              performer I could just play in a mechanical-yet-very-accurate
              manner, only paying attention to the formal and technical
              aspects of a piece. Yet this is clearly a diminished performance
              because of the absence of attention to expression, feeling or
              "ensemble" (the connection with other performers and the
              audience), those aspects of performance that fall under the
              realm of musicianship.</p>
              <p>The former attention to musical technique is only worthwhile
              if the latter attention to musicianship is present. To be a good
              musician you need to bring to bear many different ways of paying
              attention, each of which contributes to a new unique entity
              containing and combining all these integrated aspects.</p>
              <p>Such transcending of pure technique to create something
              larger than the sum of its parts, applies just as well to our
              work as software engineers.</p>
            <p>We pay attention in this creative manner because it gives us an
            enlarged, affirmative and stimulating way to participate in and
            transform the universe. Put bluntly, it brings meaning to
            life.</p>

          <p><em>To what we pay attention</em> is important. <em>How we pay

          Considering <em>why we pay attention</em> is perhaps most
          significant ~ an engaging, poignant and sadly neglected opportunity
          for self-examination.</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>I sincerely hope we all find a way to pay attention in a more
