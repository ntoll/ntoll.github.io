                      <p>Marc A.'s famous quote from the Wall Street Journal
                      article. He created the first popular graphical web

                  <p style="margin-top: 128px;">The real question is, do we direct technology, or do we
                  let ourselves be directed by it and those who have mastered
                  it? ~ <a href="https://rushkoff.com/books/program-or-be-programmed/">Doug Rushkoff</a></p>
                    <aside class="notes">
                      <p>Doug's point is that ignorance of coding disempowers
                      you in today's world. If you can code, you have autonomy
                      to make the digital world as you see fit.</p>
                      <p>Autonomy is an important aim for all educators (all
                      teachers are trying to do themselves out of a job).</p>
