                    <p>Yet 2020 is the year we all learned to try to stay
                      close while remaining (at least 2 meters) apart.</p>
                    <p>This has been a difficult time as we learn to change
                      and adapt to the new circumstances.</p>
                    <p>I'm extremely grateful for the volunteers who put on
                      EuroPython, their efforts are often taken for granted and
                      you wouldn't believe the amount of stress and number of
                      problems they will have had to put up with. Especially
                      now that EuroPython is remote.</p>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>The current situation has also brought into a focus an
                    important question:</p>
                    <p>How could folks remotely recreate the opportunity for
                    chance encounters, unexpected conversation and exploration
                    of a venue and new city with friends..?</p>
                    <p>How is such bonhomie, warmth and friendship expressed
                    most effectively through a digital medium?</p>
                    <p>Perhaps more importantly, how do we foster tolerance,
                    compassion, corrections-of-misunderstanding and all that
                    other good stuff needed so a diverse community, full of
                    differences and unique perspectives, is able to live
                    with itself without becoming fractured and toxic?</p>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>EuroPython has decided to use Discord - a chat
                    service written for gamers.</p>
                    <p>I like Discord a LOT and I'm really pleased the
                    EuroPython organisers chose it over, say, Slack or, heaven
                    forbid, Microsoft Teams or Google Hangouts.</p>
                    <p>Yet Discord is typical of the current state-of-the-art
                    (they all look and function similarly).</p>
                    <p>Yet I don't feel comfortable with the current
                    state-of-the-art.</p>
                    <p>So let's start by exploring my problems and discomfort
                    with these platforms.</p>
                    <p>Let's also try to imagine more expressive, simpler or
                    perhaps "humane" alternatives.</p>
                    <p>So let's take Discord to pieces to see what's going on.</p>

                    <p>There's a LOT going on in this application. For those
                    of us used to computers this is often easy to miss.</p>
                    <p>We are literally bombarded with data: metadata, icons,
                    timestamps, reactions, labels and silos are the norm for
                    remote written interactions.</p>
                    <p>Discord is also, ultimately, a very transactional way to
                    interact.</p>
                    <p>This is also the case with other social platforms...</p>

                    <p>Facebook feels the most "mediated" platform to me. This
                    is, most blatently, an exercise in retaining my attention
                    at all costs rather than fostering a place for
                    conversation.</p>
                    <p>Most problematic for me is the nature of our
                    interactions with such platforms.</p>

                  <p>Our socialising is reduced to interactions that
                  standardise, process and normalise our lives into a digital
                  production line of uniform social outputs ("like" something,
                  post a picture, reply with a comment, set your mood). The
                  messy, complicated and raw aspects of life, which I would
                  argue are the most valuable, fun and interesting are lost or
                  have no way to manifest themselves. We commoditize ourselves
                  into a dribble of systematized digital assets (photos, posts,
                  likes etc...).</p>

                    <p>Also, is it just me, but why do I always get the
                    impression that the design of social media has been
                    designed by Peppa Pig (soft colours, cute, neutral and
                    just a little bit infantile in tone).</p>

                    <p>Or perhaps current technical solutions to remote
                    collaboration, community and friendship feel like I'm
                    being analysed, my attention is being manipulated and I
                    either have to pay or see adverts? None of which is
                    condusive to making a place to have humane

                    <p>But that was a single-player text based virtual
                    world. Soon after the appearance of such games some
                    university students in the UK invented MUD.</p>
                    <p>A MUD (Multi-User-Dungeon) is a multi-player text based
                    adventure game. They were, and continue to be, very very
                    popular in certain parts of the net.</p>
                    <p>This is a video of me playing the origial MUD yesterday.
                    In it you'll have seen I've just finished chatting
                    with a Wizard called Pyewacket, and come acropper with
                    some rats. It is:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Low-tech - telnet (proper clients are available)</li>
                      <li>Quirky - humour, imagination, playfulness and
                      sometimes serious.</li>
                      <li>Literary - narrative driven, sense of place, time
                      and genre (usually fantasy or sci-fi).</li>
                      <li>Lots and lots of fun</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There are also many varieties of MUD. In the mid-1990s,
                    while at
                    university I would play on MOO - Multi-user-dungeon Object
                    Oriented worlds.</p>
                    <p>In a MOO the textual world is a collection of user
                    generated objects. Users program the behaviour of the world
                    as well as inhabit it.</p>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>MUD/MOO became very popular. Before all the toxic aspects of
                    current social media platforms, such behaviours were
                    manifested in these virtual textual worlds. Yet at the same
                    time, these were progressive places and I made many friends
                    all over the world at a time when such things were still
                    viewed with incredulity.</p>
                    <p>Social scientists, psychologists, literary critics,
                    artists and educators all got interested. MIT Professor
                    Sherry Turkle famously analysed such online role playing
                    as a way for folks to explore different aspects of their
                    identity in a relatively safe manner. Challenges that arise
                    allow folks to reflect upon their behaviour and to
                    know more of themselves. A sort of narrative development of
                    their lives.</p>
                    <p>Being British I spent most of my time asking my fellow
                    players what the weather was like where they were (San
                    Francisco, Paris, Tel Aviv, Singapore). This was strangely 
                    satisfying and it made me feel like a true citizen of
                    the global village delivered via the information superhighway
                    that was my 56k modem.</p>
                    <p>I also built a textual interactive
                    representation of a remote Scottish island my girlfriend
                    (now wife) and I visited over the summer of 1995. I still
                    have a backup, and it's an interactive digital momento
                    from my 21 yo self.</p>
                    <p>It was, and continues to be, fun to write, explore
                    and interact within such worlds.</p>

                  <p>What would a MUD/MOO written in 2020 look like?</p>
                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>This all feels very low-tech, but I like that. I don't
                    miss the transactional and manipulative nature of the
                    current state of the art, and the focus is definitely on
                    being in a specific place, at a certain moment, with
                    particular people.</p>
                    <p>Things I love about MUDs are that they:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Tell, rather than show. The user's imagination is
                      paramount. And this is reflected in the simple and
                      uncluttered user interfaces where the text is
                      most important.</li>
                      <li>They can be playful or serious but always tell a
                      story within a recognisable literary genre that sets the
                      scene for interactions between users.</li>
                      <li>Graphical games focus on hand/eye coordination, text
                      based worlds put narrative, meaning and intent at the
                      centre of their process.</li>
                      <li>While the reader may have to do more, the reward is
                      far greater.</li>
                      <li>Literary worlds are more egalitarian and accessible -
                      within the realm of a single developer.</li>
                      <li>Very low overhead in technical terms.</li>
                      <li>Difference between making a film or writing a
                      novel.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>So, what would a MUD/MOO written in 2020 look like?</p>

                    <p>PyWeek is a gamejam for Python developers. Organised by
                    Dan Pope, it's a wonderful hidden gem of the Python

                    <p>I entered in 2019 with my buddy Andrew Smith. Andrew is
                    an author and journalist - so we wanted to do something
                    text based.</p>
                    <p>The theme was six worlds... and we decided to create a
                    simple MOO-like game where folks could build things and
                    interact with each other in the style
                    of six different literary genres: Jane Austen, Poetic
                    Passions, Hardboiled detective novels, J.R.R.Fantasy,
                    Sci-fi and future worlds, and, of course, "Parry Hotter" -
                    so called so we didn't infringe copyright (but you get the
                    idea).</p>

                    <p>The video is a short exploration through the
                    world. It's browser based (with websockets handling
                    everything in the background), and while familiar in
                    modus operandi (the user is moving between places and
                    meeting other users), we've added a multi-media spin to

                  <p>Mission: Finish TextSmith :-)</p>
                  <aside class="notes">
                    <p>I'd had so much fun that I couldn't stop reading about
                    MUDs or coding on TextSmith.</p>
                    <p>My desire to write, create, imagine, play and explore
                    fueled my enthusiasm... as did my growing disatissfaction
                    and unease with the current state-of-the-art.</p>
                    <p>Since the UK was in lock-down, I decided to entertain
                    myself after work by re-writing TextSmith "properly".
                    It has full test coverage, docs, a scalable architecture
                    and so on... in other words, code I'd want to show the
                    world (like here at EuroPython).</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Quart - Asyncio web framework a la Flask. Provides
                        websocket support. Phil Jones, does an amazing job, and
                        it has been a joy to use.</li>
                        <li>Output to the user is framed within Jinja
                        templates.</li>
                        <li>Babel - slots into Quart. TextSmith is fully
                        translateable. Text based virtual worlds are not just
                        English virtual worlds. I want my code to respect and
                        acknowledge the diversity of folks who may use it.</li>
                        <li>The middleware of the app is Python asyncio and I
                        use some really wonderful libraries to help make this
                        easy to code. Structlog is really helpful for letting
                        me see what the application is doing, and the asyncio
                        related libraries have "just worked" for me.</li>
                        <li>Dave Beazley's SLY (Sly Lex Yacc) is used to
                        process the nascent LISP-y scripting language used by
                        players to create the behaviour of the textual world.
                        Dave's work has been a fun way for me to learn about
                        language design and implementation. Still lots of work
                        to do.</li>
                        <li>Finally, Redis is used as an object store (where
                        Python dictionaries become JSON objects stored against
                        a key). Redis is a fantastic key/value datastore with
                        a host of simple yet powerful features. It also comes
                        with a message queue used by TextSmith for inter-object
                        communication.</li>
                        <li>For example, if a user (an object) says something
                        in a room (another object), then a message from the
                        user, describing what's been said, is sent to the room
                        via the message queue.
                        Then the room itself will send messages to objects
                        representing the other users in the room, telling
                        them someone has said something. It is these messages
                        that are sent to the user's browser via
                        websockets.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>TextSmith is also designed to be scalable.</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Python instances of the app can scale
                        horizontally.</li>
                        <li>All interactions between instances are via the
                        Redis message queue.</li>
                        <li>There is, of course, a Redis cluster sitting behind
                        all this.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>However, you could always just run it as a single
                      app with Redis on the same machine.</p>
