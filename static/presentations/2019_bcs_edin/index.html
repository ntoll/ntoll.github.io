                    <p>This was definitely my feeling when it came to my own
                    similar experiences with Logo in the 1980s. While I
                    enjoyed making the "turtle" move and I learned about
                    concepts like functions, iterations and variable
                    assignment, I couldn't actually do anything useful.
                    I (like many) wanted to do real stuff (I actually used a
                    piece of software called Communitel - running on a BBC
                    micro - to set up a school BBS.</p>

                        <p>Learning music feels like learning to code (to
                        me).</p>

                    <p>Such keyboards are easy to get started with. They make
                    you sound "good" with little effort. They're a great
                    "gateway" into music and ensure *everyone* gets to have a

                    <p>However, some kids show more interest / aptitude in
                    music and want to take things further or get to do "the
                    real thing". Hence we provide instrumental lessons and
                    things like school band.</p>
                    <p>These kids are playing proper instruments, in a real band
                    and playing real (if simplified) music. They also have a
                    real conductor, have to "really" listen to each other in
                    order to play together and put on real concerts at which
                    parents pay real money for tickets.</p>
