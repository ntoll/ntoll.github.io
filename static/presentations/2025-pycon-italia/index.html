            <p>My story of the coffee machine (this is personal).</p>
            <p>Nobody asked if it was a good idea to create a technical
            solution to the "problem" of making coffee... there likely isn't
            a problem. Rather, folks feel so relieved the damn machine makes
            them a coffee that they forget they probably don't need the
            machine in the first place.</p>
            <p>Reminds me of the urban myth about the zero-G writing tool

            <p>For example, right now, the use of AI is being promoted as a

            correct in any way.</p>

            effects.</p>
            <p>Explain Tufts quality of questions research findings.</p>

            <p>Paying attention to them can often be detrimental simply
            because you cede responsibility for thinking for yourself. This
            is also perhaps true when paying attention to AI..? The computer
            says so in such a convincing manner, so it must be right.</p>
            <p>Here's the thing about such "best practices": they're often
            really stupid and rely on the inherent intelligence and
            humanity of participants to ensure they're meaningful.</p>
            <p>Just look at the poor reputation "Agile" methodology has
            these days, as rules, processes and "best practices" are
            enforced at the expense of, you know, actually intelligent,
            insightful or compassionate ways of working.</p>
            <p>Such tropes are often satirised... perhaps the most famous

            <p>As we have seen, our world is polluted by complicated and
            unpleasant computerised gizmos: "intelligent" yet crushingly
            stupid conversational agents, programmable coffee makers,
            automatic toilet flushers... most of which are banal or
            frustrating to use.</p>
            <p>Such a shallow, invasive and unfulfilling world of computing is
            perhaps inevitable. It reflects our failure to think creatively
            while we focus on automating things in the most trivial,
            complicated or inconvenient manner. Yet highlighting such a
            problematic state of affairs is helpful, for then we can
            compensate and re-balance.</p>

            <p>It's not that technology is intrinsically bad.</p>
            <p>Rather, the way we pay attention to it is often thoughtless,
            shallow and ill-judged.</p>
            <p>There are many different ways to pay attention to the world,
            and by focusing on the whole or parts thereof, each illuminates
            the other depending on the sort of attention we pay to it. The
            world is independent of us, yet how we pay attention to the world
            reveals the world to us in a certain sort of way. Such creative
            attention is a potent and fluid process of encountering,
            understanding and expressing. We discern the universe and also
            change the universe through our discerning and reacting to it. How
            we choose to pay attention (for it is certainly a choice), is a
            significant creative and moral act: it both makes and enlarges
            the world.</p>
            <p>Often we make this difficult: we forget to pay attention to
            the way we're paying attention to ourselves, each other and what's
            going on out in the universe.</p>

              <p>An inevitable musical metaphor illustrates what I mean. As a
              performer I could just play in a mechanical-yet-very-accurate
              manner, only paying attention to the formal and technical
              aspects of a piece. Yet this is clearly a diminished performance
              because of the absence of attention to expression, feeling or
              "ensemble" (the connection with other performers and the
              audience), those aspects of performance that fall under the
              realm of musicianship.</p>
              <p>The former attention to musical technique is only worthwhile
              if the latter attention to musicianship is present. To be a good
              musician you need to bring to bear many different ways of paying
              attention, each of which contributes to a new unique entity
              containing and combining all these integrated aspects.</p>
              <p>Such transcending of pure technique to create something
              larger than the sum of its parts, applies just as well to our
              work as software engineers.</p>
            <p>We pay attention in this creative manner because it gives us an
            enlarged, affirmative and stimulating way to participate in and
            transform the universe. Put bluntly, it brings meaning to
            life.</p>

            <p>Personally, I can't help but feel the missing part of our
            relationship with computers is an emphasis on things like culture,
            contemplation and creativity ~ activities and aspects of our lives
            that are affirmative, healing, empowering, raise up our existence
            or provoke useful reflection and personal growth.</p>
            <p>Contrast this vision with our current technical world: Social
            media is anything but social... it's an efficient advertising
            laboratory that turns humanity into lab rats caged in echo
            chambers of digitally digested packets of small-mindedness.
            "Artificial intelligence", "metaverse", "blockchain" and
            other such buzzwords are nerdy PR for the clever use of computers
            to unsatisfactorily automate human activity (including our latent
            prejudices). Computer games are mostly beautiful looking yet
            formulaic variations on a theme, target driven and hardly allow a
            player to express themselves. And, of course, no aspect of life is
            too small to be "solved" by an app available on your mobile device
            (a perculiarly problematic outlook ~ it's as if we're all broken
            and need technology to fix us).</p>
            <p>My challenge to you is to rise above a merely technical view of
            computers. I hope you imagine, create and participate in a
            meaningful, authentic and engaging culture expressed with and
            through computers. One in which computers become a medium for
            affirmative, liberating and expressive activities that enlarge
            ourselves, our world and our place in it.</p>
