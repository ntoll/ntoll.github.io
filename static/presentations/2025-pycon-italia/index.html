            <p>I'm actually a classically trained musician and much of my time

            training"?</p>

            political philosophy, philosophy of mind, ancient Greek philosophy

            <p>I'm a child of the 1980s. Here's my first computer.</p>
            <p>Every school had one. My dad was a head teacher. He brought his
            school's computer home at weekends and I used it to learn to
            code.</p>
            <p>I was probably 8 or 9 at the time.</p>

            <p>Computers in the 80s were not like they are today. You had to
            use your imagination. Lots of books for kids looked like this
            one (my first computer book).</p>
            <p>Who wouldn't want to create games that made you feel like
            THAT? (Despite the games only looking like a bunch of coloured
            ASCII characters on the screen).</p>

            <p>Actually, this series of books is famous in the UK. They engaged
            kids, like my 8yo self, in the nuts and bolts of programming by
            framing the code in an engaging story.</p>
            <p>This is EPIC code. I want to escape the aliens.</p>

            <p>When you look at the source code, you see it's really only a
            guessing game.</p>
            <p>But by typing in the code, correcting the mistypes (syntax
            errors) and following the debugging guide at the back of the book,
            I learned how the code worked.</p>
            <p>And then, as an adventurous 9yo, I went off piste.</p>

            <p>I have very clear memories of my aunt, uncle and cousins staying
            with my family at the time. I changed the code to something more
            like what a 9yo kid would enjoy, I invited my Uncle Colin (who was
            an engineer) to play the modified game, and sat back to watch what
            happened. Being an engineer, he thought there was some sort of
            simulation of physics going on... of course there wasn't, and
            eventually he ran into line 160.</p>
            <p>He quickly left, muttering under his breath how the computer was
            broken, and I remember laughing like a maniac when I found myself
            alone. I had somehow hoodwinked an adult by making the computer do
            something cool.</p>
            <p>I felt empowered. I felt the creative juices flowing. I was
            excited to learn what else I could get the computer to do.</p>
            <p>A quick show of hands: how many of you remember an equivalent
            empowering feeling when you started to use computers?</p>

            <p>I soon discovered new avenues of boyhood fun and mischief.</p>
            <p>When dragged off shopping with my parents, I'd wander off on my
            own to find the computer stands in retailers. This photo with the
            Lady Di look-alike is a pretty accurate representation of what
            these shops were like. Being a kid, I was mostly ignored as I typed
            code into the demonstration machines.</p>
            <p>I'd walk away (after typing RUN) and surreptitiously observe the
            next person to encounter the demonstration machines... all telling
            them they were an idiot ad infinitum.</p>
            <p>But in the end I learned an important ethical lesson.</p>
            <p>After leaving my unstoppable and mildly insulting code running
            on a BBC micro at a shop, I was horrified to see one of the retail
            assistants reprimanded by their manager. My joke wasn't funny
            and I realised my code had consequences for others. A lesson that
            stays with me to this day.</p>

            exploration and ethical lessons.</p>
            <p>I was very very lucky to have access to the BBC's computer
            literacy project, to have supportive teachers, and a teenage
            cousin who encouraged me to play.</p>
            <p>Without these foundational experiences, I wouldn't be a

            <p>This is a BBC MicroBit.</p>
            <p>In 2016 a million of these devices were manufactured so that
            every 11yo in the UK got one. Each device is capable of running
            MicroPython.</p>
            <p>The PSF were a partner in this project and I coordinated with
            Damien (the creator of MicroPython) to build the API and tooling
            for Python on the micro:bit.</p>
            <p>Happily, we were helped by a number of wonderful volunteers in
            the UK Python community.</p>
            <p>But we found that the tools the BBC wanted us to build were not
            what teachers or students wanted nor found easy to use.</p>
            <p>And so Mu was born. "How hard can it be?"</p>

            <p>What did we do to create Mu?</p>
            <p>We obsessed over teacher and student feedback. Here's a good
            example:</p>
            <p>After showing an early version of Mu to a group of teachers in
            a workshop, they explained that they always found it difficult to
            change font-size in editors - so learners at the back of the class
            could see. Honestly, it took about 5
            minutes to create a zoom-in and zoom-out button for Mu. 
            Yet for the teachers, this was a killer
            feature since it solved a fundamental pain point for them.</p>
            <p>We also wanted to be inclusive and so spent a lot of time
            learning about accessibility! We worked extensively with a blind
            developer who worked at the BBC to ensure screen readers and other
            assistive technologies worked correctly with Mu.</p>

            <p>We also paid close attention to cultural context.</p>
            <p>I spent time with French computing teachers and Welsh language
            learners.</p>
            <p>They told me that it's not the programming language itself, but
            the language of the tools that is important for helping them
            engage with learning.</p>
            <p>Also, the French can never agree on their translations. There
            have been more PRs about the French translation of Mu, than there
            have been about any other aspect of Mu. Viva la France. :-)</p>

          <p>By paying attention to Mu in a certain way, we're demonstrating
          a certain coding culture.</p>
          <p class="fragment">Mu is also the means of passing on such a culture.</p>
          <p class="fragment">That culture is open, collaborative and supportive,</p>
          <p class="fragment">...and so is Mu.</p>

            <p>I want to publicly acknowledge and celebrate my

            <p>This is what open source development is supposed to be: to
            paraphrase my buddy Brett... we came for the project and stayed for
            the community.</p>

            <p>This was my Mu related in-box a few years ago. I wasn't the only
            Mu maintainer to get such distressing abuse.</p>
            <p>Folks feel strongly about editors. We get that.</p>
            <p>But, alas, abuse of open source maintainers is very cheap in
            terms of effort.</p>
            <p>I woke up to a torrent of abusive emails on a Saturday
            morning. I was supposed to be taking my son to a wonderful game
            of football.</p>
            <p>It actually ruined my weekend.</p>
            <p>This is but the tip of the iceberg when it comes to my
            experience of problematic behaviour in the open source community,
            and especially the UK Python community.</p>
            <p>The most unhealthy thing we can do is double down on the
            "Python community is awesome" narrative, at the expense of honestly
            acknowledging there is a LOT of unpleasant and difficult stuff
            going on, in all communities.</p>
            <p>Only by speaking honestly, gently and with compassion, can we
            engage with, address and move on from the difficult stuff.</p>

            <p>We are working on an app framework for

            Python and share your work with the world.</p>
            <p>Also, if you're asking deeply technical questions of Invent,
            you're probably not the target audience for Invent.</p>

          <ul style="font-size: 0.8em;">
            <li class="fragment"><em>Pages</em> contain <em>components</em>
            used in the app 📱 🎚️   ▶️</li>
            <li class="fragment"><em>Media</em> are assets used
            by the app. 🖼️   🎶 🎥</li>
            <li class="fragment"><em>Functions</em> define custom
            behaviour. ⚙️💪</li>
            <li class="fragment"><em>Channels</em> carry messages to
            coordinate behaviour. 💬📡</li>
            <li class="fragment">The <em>Datastore</em> keeps state: it stores
            key/value data. ✍️  📖</li>
            <li class="fragment"><em>Tools</em> do async work
            then store results in the datastore. 🚚 📦</li>

            <p>So what does an Invent app look like?</p>
            <p>We designed it so you could express yourself in as few lines
            of code as possible.</p>
            <p>Teachers told us: if we can get beginners to figure out how to
            write 10 lines of code on their own in a lesson, we're winning.</p>
            <p>We also designed the API such that the code written with that
            API, when read out, tells you what it's doing.</p>
            <p>It turns out that API design is an art, with a certain aesthetic
            way of paying attention. Technical considerations are important,
            but only part of the story.</p>

            <p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...</p>
            <p>A team of Pythonistas were learning the ways of the web browser
            by typing a 1000s of lines of TypeScript into a 500k package called
            PyScript. There was huge potential, and folks looked on in wonder,
            but it was a bit heavy and unwealdy.</p>
            <p>Then WEB-YODA arrived. A powerful wielder of the ways of the
            web-browser. He took the X-Wing... sorry, PyScript, and lifted up
            the code to make it as light as a feather and easy to move
            anywhere.</p>
            <p>From being 500k (and then several Mb for Pyodide), Web Yoda
            shrank the code base to idiomatic JavaScript of around 30k,
            and with the inclusion of MicroPython (weighing in at only 170k)
            we now get Python in the browser for around 200k. Although you
            can also still use CPython too - the important thing is you have
            choices depending on what you want to achieve.</p>

            <p>I'm in Italia, we like drinking coffee with friends, right..?</p>
            <p>I have a mokka pot, and have had one for years.</p>
            <p>It is part of the ceremony of my morning routine. There is
            something rather wonderful in making coffee with a Mokka, the
            simplicity, the smell, the great tasting coffee.</p>
            <p>But I guess it's not that great if you're in a hurry though (but
            why hurry a coffee?).</p>
            <p>Yet someone, somewhere thought it a problem that we don't
            have instant coffee.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>So, instant coffee isn't so much a thoughtless solution, as
            a tasteless one.</p>
            <p>It feels to me like the annoying AI doors from H2G2 that swoosh
            with the satisfaction of a job well done.</p>
            <p>The focus is misdirected from what's important (making great
            coffee / opening a door), to something ludicrous or slightly
            insane (very fast coffee, overly polite ambient technology).

            <p>Has anyone ever had a nice cup of instant coffee?</p>
            <p>I guess it has one advantage: convenience.</p>
            <p>However, it has multiple disadvantages: that it tastes like
            dishwater being perhaps the most important.</p>

            <p>Yes, we can have great tasting coffee through the convenience
            of the touch of a button, on a machine with all the beauty of
            a collection of spare parts for a DALEK.</p>
            <p>But what about the ceremony of coffee making?</p>
            <p>This is a 7 minute video of a model plugging things in and
            pressing buttons. It kinda reminds me of setting up a misbehaving
            laser printer.</p>
            <p>Also, this is about as much fun as writing YAML to configure
            a k8s cluster.</p>

          <p>So I've already mentioned H2G2 a few times. Douglas Adams, a
          technology enthusiast, understood and lampooned the tasteless design
          and use of computing...</p>
          <p>I'm going to read you a quote from Douglas Adams. It's about
          Sirius Cybernetics Corp - who make all sorts of "convenient"
          technical solutions in the H2G2 universe. Here's the quote:</p>
          <p>It is very easy to be blinded to the essential useless-ness
          of [their products] by the sense of achievement you get from getting
          them to work at all. In other words &mdash; and this is the rock
          solid principle on which the whole of the Corporation's Galaxy-wide
          success is founded &mdash; <em>their fundamental design flaws are
          completely hidden by their superficial design flaws.</em></p>

            first place.</p>
            <p>Nobody asked if it was a good idea to create a technical
            solution to the "problem" of making coffee... there likely isn't
            a problem. Rather, folks feel so relieved the damn machine makes
            them a coffee that they forget they probably don't need the

          <h2>"Best practices" 🤣😱😭</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>And so, at last, we come to "best practices" that promise to
            solve all our problems.</p>
            <p>For example, right now, the use of AI is being promoted as a
            "best practice" in coding. But let's just remember that AI is just
            an acronym for PR.</p>
          </aside>

        <section data-background-video="video/eleGPT.webm">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>AI was bound to make an appearance at some point. You can't
            help but be amazed by some of the results it produces.</p>
            <p>What I find interesting is how we pay attention to the outputs
            from AI. That it looks convincing doesn't necessarily mean it's
            correct in any way.</p>
            <p>I'm also delightfully amazed at the way in which AI
            misdirects its attention... often with comic or unfortunate side
            effects.</p>
            <p>Research from Tufts shows that the quality of questions used to
            prompt LLMs has a direct influence on the quality of the responses
            to such questions. Students who already know a bit about coding ask
            sensible questions and get helpful outputs. Furthermore, they can
            tell when the LLM is hallucinating. Inexperienced students tend to
            ask crazy questions, and get equally crazy responses. Something
            such inexperienced folks cannot begin to judge.</p>
            <p>Perhaps taking advice from an AI is not "best practice"?</p>
            <p>But what I really want to know is, where does such "best
            practice" come from?</p>

            <p>Beware people who offer themselves as gurus, who
            promote a "system" or offer pithy "best practices".</p>
            <p>Paying attention to them can often be detrimental simply
            because you cede responsibility for thinking for yourself. Perhaps
            this is also true when paying attention to AI..? The computer
            says so in such a convincing manner, so it must be right.</p>
            <p>Here's the thing about such "best practices": they're often
            really stupid and rely on the inherent intelligence and
            humanity of participants to ensure they're actually meaningful.</p>
            <p>Just look at the poor reputation "Agile" methodology has
            these days, as rules, processes and "best practices" are
            enforced at the expense of, you know, actual intelligence,
            insight or compassionate ways of working.</p>
            <p>Happily, such tropes and practices are ripe for satire... for
            poking fun is a great way to make a pertinent point. Perhaps the
            most famous example of this being Doug Zonkger's "Chicken".</p>

            <p>Computers are not just machines for rapidly evaluating logical
            instructions. They are a medium through which we share and express
            our values, cultures, social world and forms of life. They are
            only valuable because we are able to create and express things of
            significance through computers. Furthermore, the way we express
            things with computers, and that we choose this form of expression
            is also of cultural significance. Like other forms of creative
            endeavour, computers reflect those who make, inhabit and
            collaborate in such a medium.</p>
            <p>As we have seen, our world is polluted by complicated and
            unpleasant computerised gizmos: "intelligent" yet crushingly
            stupid conversational agents, programmable coffee makers,
            automatic toilet flushers... most of which are banal or
            frustrating to use.</p>
            <p>Such a shallow, invasive and unfulfilling world of computing

            <p>It's not that technology is intrinsically bad.</p>

            shallow and ill-judged. We often lose the sense of fun, flourishing
            and fulfilment we encountered in the opening three stories.</p>
            <p>How we pay attention to the world
            reveals the world to us in a certain sort of way. Such creative
            attention is a potent and fluid process of encountering,
            understanding and expressing. We discern the universe and also
            change the universe through our discerning and reacting to it.</p>
            <p>We pay attention in this creative manner because it gives us an
            enlarged, affirmative and stimulating way to participate in and
            transform the universe. Put bluntly, it brings meaning to
            life.</p>

            creative process of flow and change. "Panta rhei" as Heraclitus

          <p class="fragment">GURU: Good judgement.</p>

            <p>Perhaps the most important thing to which we can pay attention
            is ourselves.</p>
            <p>As this "secret" reveals, this is a tricky thing to do.</p>

          <p><em>To what we pay attention</em> is important.
          <span class="fragment"><em>How we pay attention</em> is equally
          consequential but often unconscious.</span>
          <span class="fragment">Considering <em>why we pay attention</em> is
          perhaps most significant</span><span class="fragment"> ~ an
          engaging, poignant and sadly neglected opportunity for
          self-examination.</span></p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>If we don't attempt compassionate self examination nor engage
            with each other with a sense of respect and humanity we end up like
            tech-bros.</p>
            <p>These are folks for whom computing is merely a shallow
            performance in extracting money through human/computer
            interactions. There is no artistry, humanity or morality in what
            they do. A rather wasted effort in my not so humble opinion.</p>

  bleating about the Pythonic weather.

Don't be the sheep cut off from the mass,
  unable to pass,
  as someone,
  with something,
  interesting
  to
  say...

Their mental masturbation ejaculates
  ever-fruitless discourse:

Repackaged reportage from Hacker News,
  Performative patronising technical reviews,
Name dropping semi-famous nerds,
  An infinite garbage of computer-y words.
Detached and empty with no spark of life.
  The real world ignored, to cut off its strife.
So clever they lack the intelligence to know,
  We are vital and luminous souls who grow
Through connections and feelings and deep self revealings,
  But their work fills the world with VC funded dealings.
Squeezing huge profits through inhumane code,
  We're exploitable data points, with privacy to erode.

What do we call such a desperate crew?
A wank of tech bros, that'll do.</code></pre>

            <p>So, my challenge to you is to rise above a merely technical view
            of computers. I hope you imagine, create and participate in a
            meaningful, authentic and engaging culture expressed with and
            through computers. One in which Python becomes a medium for
            affirmative, liberating and expressive activities that enlarge
            ourselves, our world and our place in it.</p>
