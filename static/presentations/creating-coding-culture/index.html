            <p>I learned about all sorts of things:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Theory</b>: How to read musical notes.</li>
              <li><b>Delivery</b>: How to use my tuba to play notes in the
              first octave.</li>
              <li><b>Infrastructure</b>: How to wear a tuxedo for an orchestra
              concert.</li>
              <li><b>Best practices</b>: Like turning the pages of the score
              without making them rustle in the quiet bits.</li>
              <li><b>Next steps</b>: advanced concepts to look out for and pick
              up in my first gig, like key signatures and time signatures.</li>
              <li>But out of cohort of 50, only 5 graduated.</li>
              <li>Out of those five, four of us (80%) have found jobs relating
              to music (although non of us actually play our instruments).</li>

              just graduated from a music boot camp?</li>
              <li>Dangerous PR: over promising, set up folks to struggle in the
              industry, and promoting an imagined hipster-hacker
              lifestyle.</li>
