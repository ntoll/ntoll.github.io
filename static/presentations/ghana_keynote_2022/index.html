              <li>Given the focus on Python in education, I'm going to explore
              the journey of learning to program in Python.</li>
              <li>It will be technical, educational, and thoughtful.</li>

            <p>David Allen, the project's producer, explained that, "[t]he aim
            was to democratise computing. We didn't want people to be
            controlled by it, but to control it."</p>
            <p>That feeling of empowerment... I can make cool stuff happen.</p>

            <pre>Code runs our world.

Yet code isn't written for computers.

We write code because we are human beings
  imbued with ideas, imagination and feelings.
Code expresses our thoughts made digital:
  a medium for our values, cultures and ways of life.

If you knew code, what would you create?

CodeGrades are to code,
  as belts are to martial arts:
Steps on a journey to experience.

Learn and level up with coding projects,
  the higher the grade, the greater the challenge.

We help you:
  learn coding with highly-skilled programmers,
  build a portfolio to show your progress, and,
  master the art of coding on a journey of personal and technical discovery.

We'll be with you for every step...

Because those who venture into the world of code
  will be the ones inventing our future.

What will your contribution be..?

The only way to find out, is to try.
