<p>In the latter years of the 19th century the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement">Arts and Crafts movement</a>
grew from the ideas and work of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ruskin">John Ruskin</a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morris">William Morris</a> and their
collaborators. Rather than a particular artistic style, it was an approach to
community organisation, an appreciation of the impulse behind artistic
endeavours, and an attitude to the process of creating and making.</p>
<p>Work within this movement was diverse in style, execution and medium:
it could encompass a colourful and richly decorated stained glass window, a
simple rustic wooden table, medieval inspired typefaces, arboreal silverware,
classical music inspired by English folksong or Renaissance composers,
wallpaper patterns made from stylised tessellation of plants and animals, a
red-brick neo-Gothic family home, and political, commercial or religious
organisations with a vernacular, cooperative, emergent and egalitarian outlook.</p>

</figcaption></figure><p>Arts and Crafts was a reaction to the worst of the British Industrial
Revolution: ornate and over-elaborate massed produced objects shoddily created
via mechanised factories, ignorant of the qualities of the materials used nor
the lives, skills and culture[s] of the workers involved. For the Arts and
Crafts movement such objects, and the practices used to create them, had a
detrimental effect on our world and the lives lived within it.</p>
<p>Arts and Crafts engaged with, and was an alternative perspective to, the
complicated cultural and commercial status quo of its time. It emerged as an
influential and widely admired movement that is
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/apr/11/the-guardian-view-on-william-morris-how-the-strawberry-thief-took-over-the-world">still popular today</a>.</p>
<p>What could we learn and recapture from the Arts and Crafts, as we reflect upon
the equivalent knotty aspects of our own contemporary culture? It's plausible
that shallow brand-led consumerism, unconscious automated manufacturing,
efficiency obsessed supply chain practices and technology-enabled
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a>
(that dominate our contemporary culture) are correspondingly damaging to the
environment and our ability to lead flourishing and fulfilling lives.</p>
<p>For me, the alternative perspective of the Arts and Crafts resonates.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it's about paying attention.</p>
<p>How we pay attention reveals the world in a certain sort of way. Such attention
changes the world through our actions embodying subsequent understanding,
interpretation and reaction to things <em>from that certain perspective</em>.
Reflecting upon how one pays attention is, therefore, of fundamental
importance. For such introspection cultivates a more enlarged and multifarious
encounter with the world: an opportunity to become conscious of how one's own
attention changes and is changed, while it is itself changing the world in
which we live. Put succinctly, pay attention to paying attention!</p>
<p>In <a href="../why-computers-1/">previous blog posts</a> I've described this way of
paying attention as a <em>brain twist</em>: the challenge to acquire a new perspective
about seemingly everyday things. The external world remains as it was, but you
have changed and thus see the world differently by paying attention with the
benefit of a new perspective. It's that "aha" feeling when a cartoon lightbulb
appears above your head.</p>
<p>Here's an aesthetic example of such a change of attention, from the perspective
of the Arts and Crafts movement.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/29906/pg29906-images.html#page028">famous passage</a>
from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Painters">Modern Painters</a>, John
Ruskin gave a celebrated definition of two types of beauty. The first, which he
called "typical" beauty, is easy to understand because it is conventional.
Typical beauty is the external quality of an object - how it may
appear to us through our senses, <em>"whether it occurs in a stone, flower, beast
or man"</em>. The second, "vital" beauty, is where I find the brain twist. For it
encompasses the, <em>"felicitous fulfilment of function in living things"</em> and
the, <em>"joyful and right exertion of perfect life"</em>. In other words, vital
beauty relates to the quality of the expressive, moral and social effects of a
work. As Ruskin put it, <em>"the art of any country is the exponent of its social
and political values"</em>.</p>
<p>In <em>Modern Painters</em> Ruskin defended the later paintings of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._W._Turner">J.M.W. Turner</a> that were
savaged by art critics of the time. Ruskin felt that to perfectly
capture a scene with great accuracy (as one may naively suggest a photograph
might do) is a fools' game because, <em>"no good work whatever can be perfect, and
the demand for perfection is always a sign of a misunderstanding of the ends of
art"</em>. From Ruskin's perspective, this is because nothing can be completely
seen, since the painter always creates via their own limited experience of the
scene: from their unique (and thus incomplete) point of view. In the works of
Turner Ruskin found an artist who expressed, through their paintings, a more
fundamental way to pay attention to a scene. For Ruskin, Turner's focus was not
how "real" or "accurate" the painting looked (the "typical") but how he, the
painter, sees the more meaningful ("vital") aspects the scene. Such vital
aspects are expressed through the skillful use of colour, contrasting light and
shade, or brush techniques that subtly suggest, rather than accurately capture,
the presence of things in the scene. Turner's genius is to give a more honest
and truthful rendition of a scene <em>as the artist sees it</em>, although this
actually makes the painting appear more unreal from a "typical" and thus
incomplete point of view.</p>

</figcaption></figure><p>The "vital" aspects of Turner's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Slave_Ship">The Slave Ship</a> (shown above)
encompass Turner's moral and political view of the scene - acknowledging the
horrific events carried out by slavers, throwing overboard the dead and dying
as a storm brews in the distance. Turner's work ensures the viewer has an
opportunity to encounter and reflect upon such deeper and more meaningful
aspects of the painting ~ above and beyond a superficially "accurate" rendition
of the scene. I find myself first seeing a seascape with a dramatic sunset,
then I notice the tall ship careering into a storm that looks like a demonic
presence reaching into the painting from the left hand side. Finally
I notice figures at the bottom of the scene in the foreground: a tangle of
limbs and chains, into which I'm dismayed to discover are painted sea creatures
and gulls feeding on those cast overboard. That I notice the human tragedy last
of all is telling: Turner forces me to acknowledge my lack of awareness of
the situation of slaves... followed by the self-realisation that such a lack of
paying attention to slaves is perhaps a typical response from someone
ignorantly encountering slavery.</p>
<p>It stops me in my tracks.</p>
<p>It is powerful stuff.</p>
<p>I am deeply moved.</p>
<p>Notice this depends upon my paying attention to the painting in a certain
receptive manner (sympathetic to the "vital" beauty contained therein). Were I
ignorant of Ruskin's brain-twist I may remark that the picture is just a
messy and not especially convincing picture of a ship.</p>
<p>This is where the industrial revolution went wrong (from the point of view of
Arts and Crafts): by focusing on the superficially typical beauty of mass
manufactured objects at the expense of sharing and exploring works of vital
beauty and depth.</p>
<p>Does this feel familiar?</p>
<p>Let's consider for a moment a corresponding view of the computerised world of
the 21st century.</p>
<p>The typically beautiful looking social media app lacks the vital beauty of
promoting a fulfilling and flourishing social life. Rather, it's a nefarious
vehicle for shallow gossip and the delivery of (typically beautiful looking)
adverts based upon invasive data collection. Your calorie counting app might
help you measure your typical energy intake, but it isn't enlarging your
awareness of the vitally delicious, healthy and skilfully prepared food you
<em>could</em> be eating as part of a healthy lifestyle. It's actually a very specific
and not particularly nourishing way of paying attention to the world (in fact,
it's a tragically shallow and joyless exercise in data collection). The
typically hi-tech coffee maker in your kitchen constantly reminds you of its
presence via a glowing display that indicates the levels of coffee
beans, water and limescale, and instantly gives you a cup of coffee at the
touch of a button. How convenient? Alas, the vital and gentle ceremony of
brewing coffee in a pot with the associated sensory and emotional stimulation
it creates - the smell it produces, the relaxing aural experience of the
bubbling sound or the opportunity to lovingly prepare a cup of coffee for
someone else - is lost to a device that may look sleek and modern yet has all
the lovability of a spare part for a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek">Dalek</a>.</p>
<p>The qualities of such artefacts reflect our way of paying attention to the
world. As my examples demonstrate, at this moment in time our culture is often
tragically obsessed with typical beauty and efficient convenience while
ignoring or squashing latent vital beauty and the possibility for gentle and
nourishing rituals or encounters with others. Furthermore, our culture has an
unhealthy obsession with data and quantitative measurement as a means to
"accurately" (typically) describe and pay attention to the world. To be clear,
I'm not against data gathering nor quantitative measurement - these are
demonstrably very useful and often essential for hoped-for outcomes and
important informative analysis. The problem is with our attention: the
tragically ignorant or inappropriate way to engage with and pay attention to
the world in a relentlessly quantitative manner (we've measured it, so it must be
true!). For instance, focusing on the number of "likes" on a social media post
to indicate a meaningful social life, or counting calories as a proxy for
healthy living, or coffee bean status as an important aspect of enjoying a
drink with your loved one at breakfast.</p>
<p>Such misplacement of attention has an unfortunate side effect, a sort of self
fulfilling aspect. By choosing to pay attention to things in quantitative 
manner - a manner that gives an apparently clear "typical" answer - we get
into a situation where anything that gives such an apparently clear answer
becomes a priority. Why? Because we're able to quantify our quantitative outlook
(we now have 173% more data points than last time, so it must be more
accurate!). But in doing so we become blind to the vital process or quality of
expressing other aspects of the world in more creative, intuitive, subtle or
nuanced ways. The world is not black and white, nor even shades of grey, but
full of colour, texture and subtlety (like a Turner painting).</p>
<p>Remember, it's not quantitative measurement that's at fault here (as I mentioned,
that's often very useful!). Rather, it's our misplaced attention that's causing
the problem. Such misplaced emphasis of attention inevitably leads to a
crushingly banal and limited view of the world.</p>
<p>It's not fun. It's not rewarding. It's not even helpful.</p>
<p>In fact, it's probably dangerous because it ignores all the things that make
life worth living: a fluid aesthetic process of encountering, understanding and
expressing. Hence the importance of paying attention to "paying attention" to
enlarge our encounters with the world and each other.</p>
<p>Here's another brain twist: my complaints are perennial, for every age is full
of arty-farty humanist aesthetes (like me in this article) bemoaning the
shallowness of their contemporary culture. Yet truth be told, if we only pay
attention to the world in this more "vital" and aesthetic manner, we are just
as incomplete and blind as those caught up in the "typical" or accurate view
of the world.</p>
<p>Once again, the key is to pay attention to "paying attention". Ask yourself, is
the sort of attention you bring to a situation the one that most helpfully
reveals what's going on? Or perhaps trying several ways of paying attention
is most beneficial to engaging with things? Maybe even a blended approach, to
synthesise different ways of paying attention into a more subtle, nuanced and
enlarged view, is possible?</p>
<p>The Arts and Crafts movement realised this and deliberately emphasised the
integration of "vital" elements into typically "typical" aspects of their
commercial endeavours. For example, William Morris encouraged <em>useful work</em>
over <em>useless toil</em> and emphasised meaning and respect when collaborating.
Their approach often favoured synthesis of vernacular traditions over a
reductionist analysis of "products", in the belief that the quality of the work
thus created reflected the qualities of the dynamic living culture in which it
originated. For Morris, one should be fulfilled by such work, created within a
recognisable (and thus authentic) shared cultural tradition, rather than
crushed or alienated by artefacts, designed by committee, based on "data" and
manufactured via automated production processes. Such work was to emerge from
the bottom up - from those crafting the work - rather than through a managed
top down technocratic structure. For the Arts and Crafts practitioner, their
(typical) technique enabled (vital) expression rather than merely being a means
of production. Importantly, such work took place in the context of guilds and
privately owned companies (such as Morris's own Morris &amp; Co.) which
involved the "typical" bureaucracy of running a commercial enterprise or
cooperative, all the while paying attention to the "vital" work of creation and
collaboration.</p>
<p>This emphasis on the vernacular meant paying attention like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus">Janus</a>, both backwards and forwards in
time, to the culture in which one was creating. Morris was inspired by the work
of medieval artisans, their system of guilds and the way their work existed
within traditions of practice, style and organisation. Morris also wrote
utopian science fiction, such as his novel
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_from_Nowhere">News from Nowhere</a> that
imagined a future agrarian society based on common ownership, democratic
government and progressive cultural ideals fashionable at the time among his
compatriots in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_League_(UK,_1885)">Socialist League</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The past is not dead, it is living in us, and will be alive in the future
which we are now helping to make.</p>
<p>~ William Morris</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paying attention to paying attention enables us to mix, contrast and
integrate different ways to encounter the flow and change of our world.
Such diverse and multifarious encounters lead to a richer, enlarged and
deeper understanding of the universe. Ultimately, we cultivate a bountiful
repertoire of disparate and resonant material, skills and experiences upon
which we draw as we react to our world by expressing ourselves with
creative and collaborative endeavours.</p>
<p>As artists and crafts-folk (meant in the broadest sense) mature and refine
their technique their wisdom, gained by paying attention to the experience of
living in a complex and ever changing world, is found in the fruits of
creative work. Their presence, embodied through such works, makes available
their acquired and unique perspective to those who will engage.</p>
<p>Cultivating those vital aspects of the external world that grow and nourish
oneself from within is the work of a lifetime. Our current culture, of problems
to be fixed, arbitrary achievements to unlock and self-worth expressed as a
measurable external quantity (typically money, number of cars, size of home
etc) is the antithesis of this most important work. For our self-esteem, if
expressed in terms of possessions, will always be unrequited.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no wealth but life. Life, including all its powers of love, of joy,
and of admiration. That country is the richest which nourishes the greatest
numbers of noble and happy human beings; that man is richest, who, having
perfected the functions of his own life to the utmost, has also the widest
helpful influence, both personal, and by means of his possessions, over the
lives of others.</p>
<p>~ John Ruskin</p>
