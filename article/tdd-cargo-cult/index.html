    <p>The <a href="../how-to-run-an-awesome-code-dojo">London Python Code
Dojo</a> is a great place to share ideas and collaborate
with an enthusiastic and friendly group of peers. I'm going to tell the story
of an interesting outcome from last Thursday's dojo - organised with great
aplomb by Python core developer and Windows guru
<a href="https://twitter.com/tjguk">Tim Golden</a>.</p>

<p>We departed from the usual democratic method of choosing a dojo task: Tim
decided that as we regularly solved problems concerning board games it would
be good to produce a "one true board" code library to re-use in future dojos.
To this end Tim created a <a href="https://github.com/ldnpydojo/board">Github
repository</a> containing a single README.rst file containing requirements.
We were to fork the repository, create a directory for our team's code and send
a pull request after the dojo so posterity could have a good laugh at our
solutions.</p>

<p>I found myself in a team with general all-round-nice-guy-and-man-about-the-technological-town <a href="https://twitter.com/rrees">Robert Rees</a>.
He's a hugely experienced, well read and thoughtful senior developer
/ architect at <a href="http://guardian.co.uk">The Guardian</a>. He's also
always ready to step up to share his successes, failures and discoveries with
others (he opened the evening with an excellent lightning talk on functional
programming with Python). Once again, he proved to have an excellent eye
for a learning opportunity...</p>

<p>During the team discussion Robert suggested we work using strict test
driven development (TDD): focus on a specific thing that needed implementing,
write a test for just that thing, make it pass then rinse and repeat until all
requirements are met with no failing tests. We took it in turns to write code.
At the end of each turn the "programmer" wrote a failing test for the next
person in the group to solve, and so the cycle continued. Given that we had
very clear requirements in the form of Tim's README file this was an excellent
suggestion on Robert's part.</p>

<p>Thanks to Robert, what happened next was both funny and educational...</p>

<p>I set up the basic scaffolding for the project and Robert quickly created a
"Board" class containing some stubbed out yet obvious methods and an associated
test stub. Team-mate and <a href="http://www.pygame.org/">Pygame</a> core
developer <a href="https://twitter.com/renedudfield">Rene Dudfield</a> read
out the next requirement,</p>

<blockquote>"You should be able to put something at a coordinate on the
board."</blockquote>

<p>A suitable test was written and the next team member (another Nick) sat in
the hot seat. Rather than implement a complex or complete solution to the
requirement he was encouraged, in true TDD fashion, to do the minimum to make
the test pass. So, he hard coded the return value expected by the test, in this
case the string <code>"Foo"</code>.</p>

<p>It was at this point that I made the mistake of opening my big mouth
(again). I said something along the lines of, "the problem with unit tests are
that they're behaviourist in outlook: they don't ensure that the internal
quality of the solution is any good - simply that the solution passes some
tests" i.e. it displays such-and-such a behaviour.</p>

<p>I was referring to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism">
behaviourist movement</a> founded by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Watson">J.B.Watson</a> where
things can only be defined in terms of observable behaviours - there is no room
for introspection. When taken to an extreme, behaviourist philosophy claims
that a person has no consciousness but is simply a thing that behaves. Of
course, there are problems with this outlook. The obvious question of what is
meant by "behaviour" is far more difficult to answer than it at first appears.
More problematic, behaviourism seems counter to personal "internal" experience:
pain, love, sadness and joy are common feelings yet may not be manifested in
externally observable behaviour. Furthermore, behaviours associated with such
feelings can be easily and convincingly aped (for example, by actors or con
artists) which may even be a requirement for more complex interactions such as
irony (where you act one way but mean something else - often the opposite to
how you act).</p>

<p>Given that we were enjoying the silly exercise of making tests pass with the
minimum of effort Robert stepped up with a new challenge: he would write a
test to force the development of something sensible. This would show that test
driven development inevitably leads to a good solution by forcing us to make
the failing test pass.</p>

<p>We found Robert had written the following:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def test_pieces_are_placed_and_restored(self):
    width = 4000
    height = 4000
    board = Board(width, height)
    pieces = [(random.randint(0, width), random.randint(0, height),
              {"i": random.randint(0, 5000)}) for x in
              range(0, random.randint(0, 57000))]
    for piece in pieces:
        board.place(piece[0], piece[1], piece[2])
        self.assertEquals(board.get(piece[0], piece[1])["i"], piece[2])
    self.assertEquals(len(board.contents()), len(pieces))</code></pre>

<p>His test creates a huge board, places random pieces at random locations on
the board, checks that expected pieces are found in the correct location on the
board and finally ensures the board's "contents" contain the same number of
pieces that the test randomly created.</p>

<p>Surely we had to write a quality solution to make such a test pass?</p>

<p>I'm ashamed to say that we met Robert's challenge by intentionally creating
a monster (including suggestions from Robert himself). At the top of our board
module we wrote this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">import random
random.seed('robert rees was here')</code></pre>

<p>Then we updated the <code>Board</code> class's <code>get</code> method
to:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def get(self, x, y):
    if self.max_x == 4000:
       # Take that @rrees
       if not hasattr(self, 'rrees'):
           random.seed('robert rees was here')
           width = self.max_x
           height = self.max_y
           self.rrees = [(random.randint(0, width), random.randint(0, height),
                         {"i": random.randint(0, 5000)}) for x in
                         range(0, random.randint(0, 57000))]
           self.counter = 0
       result = self.rrees[self.counter]
       self.counter += 1
       return {'i': result[2]}
   else:
       return "Foo"</code></pre>

<p>Our solution re-set the random number generator's seed to <code>"robert
rees was here"</code> so the resulting sequence of "random" numbers was
deterministic (i.e. they would always be the same set of random-ish numbers -
one of the reasons why it's more correct to call these sorts of things a
pseudo-random number generator). Then we copied the code from Robert's unit
test to return the result that the test expected. The outer <code>if</code>
statement ensured that we return the correct result depending on different
tests that set the board to different sizes - Robert's test set the dimensions
to 4000x4000 whereas another, as was mentioned before, expected the result
<code>"Foo"</code>.</p>

<p>This is, of course, an abomination.</p>

<p>However, it allowed us to play our parts in the ruse that started our
"show-and-tell" presentation. We explained we had carefully linked tests to
requirements in Tim's README file and talked through the programming cycle I
explained earlier to ensure everyone had a go at writing code. We even audited
the unit tests in front of the assembled dojo and ran the test suite so people
could see that everything was working in accordance with the tests. It was only
until we revealed the code for the actual <code>Board</code> class that the
joke was discovered.</p>

<p>And so we get to the point of this blog post: test driven development is
promoted as the <em>one true way to great code</em>. Our activity in the dojo
shows that this is not the case. Although we were nefarious in our intent a
similar result (abominable code) could easily be produced through inexperience,
laziness or lack of care and attention while still <em>doing</em> TDD.</p>

<p>The "test-driven" dogma is dangerous: it claims to improve the quality of
code so long as you follow its modus operandi. At best this fosters a false
sense of security, at worse it's simply a cargo cult.</p>

<p>I think having <strong>well tested code is a useful and often essential
element of great software</strong>. I'm not saying "you shouldn't test code!"
(you most definitely should). Rather, I'm concerned that TDD apologists do more
harm than good by promoting a cargo cult. Testing software is a good thing
and sometimes writing tests before implementing a feature is the right thing
to do. But this is simply evidence of the most important element that leads to
great code - an element that, unfortunately, is not mentioned by TDD - the
wisdom of the programmer.</p>

<p>What do I mean?</p>

<p>I mean the state where knowledge, experience and trust coincide with the
understanding and confidence to do the "right thing" rather than follow a list
of precepts.</p>
