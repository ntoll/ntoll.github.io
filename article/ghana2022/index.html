    <p>It was an extraordinary privilege to be one of the keynote speakers at this
year's <a href="https://gh.pycon.org/">PyCon Ghana</a>. I was also very lucky to have the
support of my employer (<a href="https://anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a>) who covered the
costs associated with the trip for myself and my colleague,
<a href="https://cheuk.dev/">Cheuk</a>.</p>
<p>While this was my first trip to Ghana (actually, it was my first trip to
Africa), this was not my first Ghanaian interaction.</p>
<p>I can't begin to describe how important and nourishing the stimulating
interactions I've had with Ghana based friends Mannie and Michael have been.
Two years ago we were introduced by our mutual friend Conrad Ho, and since then
have met every month, in video calls, to discuss Python in education. The work
done by the Ghanaian Python community to engage in educational activities is
truly inspiring, and you can find out more
<a href="https://www.pythonghana.org/">here</a>.</p>
<p>That both Mannie and Michael are part of the PyCon Ghana organising team, and
this year's focus was on Python in education give a clue as to how I got
invited.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/accra.jpg" alt="A view from our accommodation"><figcaption>The view of Accra from our accommodation.</figcaption></figure><p>After an eventful flight to Accra, both Cheuk and I went exploring during our
first full day. Adjacent to our accommodation was Oxford Street, containing
lots of shops, banks and other useful things we needed to visit. My immediate
impression was very positive... the Ghanaian folk we met were all friendly
and welcoming. "Good morning", "Hello", "Welcome to Ghana" and other such
greetings were common as we walked through the streets.</p>
<p>We also met the PyCon Ghana organisers at the venue. Having been involved with
community organising for well over a decade, I looked on in sympathy and (where
possible) got stuck in trying to help get everything set up. Like most aspects
of the Python community, PyCon Ghana is run by volunteers, and I'd like to
acknowledge their strength of character, friendliness and can-do attitude, led
by their chair, Francis. I saw first hand, that the Ghanaian Python community
is in good hands.</p>
<p>Sadly, I was ill on Thursday's tutorial day. My son had shared his cold with
me and it meant I had to stay home instead of attend Cheuk's amazing
<a href="https://humbledata.org/">humble data</a> workshop. But the enforced day of rest
meant I was ready for Friday and Saturday at the conference.</p>
<p>I was honoured to meet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nii_Quaynor">Nii Quaynor</a>
a Ghanaian gentleman who is often described as the father of the African
internet and an inductee to the <a href="https://www.internethalloffame.org/">Internet Hall of Fame</a>.
Nii eloquently spoke with considerable experience and authority of the
challenges and opportunities for working with governmental and international
agencies. I hope folks were paying attention since the Python community
in Ghana could be a significant contributor and collaborator in the technical
growth of the country.</p>
<p>There were also many other interesting talks, panels and workshops happening at
the event which made it feel like a typical Python conference found anywhere in
the world.</p>
<p>My first proper contribution to the conference was to run a two day workshop
on MicroPython on the micro:bit for young people. I have to say this was an
absolute joy and, assisted by Anthony and Joanna, we were also joined by
a collection of teachers, tech folk and IoT curious. The vibe was friendly and
the young people brought lots of energy and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Here's a video, shot on the second day while folks were building a project with
their micro:bit, to give a flavour of what went on.</p>

<p>Many thanks to the <a href="https://microbit.org/">MicroBit Foundation</a> for supporting
PyCon Ghana via the donation of 20 devices for participants to use and then
keep. Every device found a safe home, with many asking where they can be
obtained in Ghana..!</p>
<p>My keynote, on the subject of Python in Education, went well and as usual, I
especially enjoyed answering the questions at the end.</p>
<p>I was especially pleased to channel my "inner teacher" by (half jokingly)
setting the conference some homework.</p>
<p>I pointed out that somewhere will become known as a place of African technical
innovation. Somewhere will be lauded as having the most accessible and
creative coding education programme in Africa. Somewhere will famously
contribute a uniquely African story to our global technical community.</p>
<p>I asked, "why not you..?".</p>
<p>My homework task to the audience was to discover and become their own unique,
colourful and extraordinary community. They already have a small but strong,
vibrant and close knit nucleus from which to grow.</p>
<p>I hope, in ten years time,
to visit Ghana again and have some of today's community say to me, "see what
we did, and look where we're going...", and for me to be amazed.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/ghana.jpg" alt="Ghanaian friends."><figcaption>Ghanaian friends.</figcaption></figure><p>Another aspect of the conference was its friendliness.</p>
<p>During the breaks I
spoke to many different people, from all over Africa, and drew energy from
their passion, enthusiasm and openness.</p>
<p>I also enjoyed the warmth of their
conversation and willingness to share games with me... I especially appreciated
learning how to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oware">Oware</a> from PyCon
Ghana organiser, Hillary. I enjoyed it so much I managed to buy a board in a
market in Accra and have taught my kids and wife how to play..! It's a big hit
in our house.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/accra_beach.jpg" alt="The amazing view of a beach from the old presidential residence."><figcaption>The amazing view of a beach from the old presidential residence.</figcaption></figure><p>On my final day, the day after the conference, we hung out with the conference
organisers and visited tourist sites in Accra. It was wonderful to see
non-Pythonic aspects of Ghana... its cultural spaces, historic monuments, the
university and glimpse some of its natural beauty.</p>
<p>Through the course of my stay, I saw the twi word "akwaaba" in many places.</p>
<p>When I asked what it meant I was told it was a sort of very hospitable form of
"welcome".</p>
<p>"Akwaaba" is a pretty good word to describe my experience of PyCon Ghana.</p>
<p>Long may the Ghanaian Python community flourish and I look forward to 2032. ;-)</p>
