    <p>Yesterday was our first proper "touring" day, and we made the most of our relative
(but not actual) closeness to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machynlleth">Machynlleth</a>
to visit
the <a href="https://cat.org.uk/">Centre for Alternative Technology</a> (CAT) - an
inspiring organisation that specialises in sustainable living.</p>
<p>When we first visited CAT back in 1995, it turned out to be a perfect day both
of us fondly remember. We have returned several times since and enjoyed
watching the site, educational work and influence of the CAT organisation 
flourish and grow.</p>
<p>As someone fascinated with technology (and I'll informally define that as,
<em>crafting the world through creativity and coherent invention to better engage
and interact with it to some valuable aim or benefit</em>), the "alternative" part
of the CAT name has always appealed to me.</p>
<p>I'm a software engineer, a job most folks imagine is at the heart of "new" or
"hi"-tech. Yet I, and many of my colleagues, will tell you that "new"
and "hi"-tech is not necessarily the same as "good". The focus on "alternative"
appeals to the engineer in me: it means I'm not constrained to frame my
thinking via the tired stereotypes found in our culture.</p>
<p>A good example of what I mean is the first thing you see upon arrival at CAT, a
water powered funicular railway.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa6/water_powered_rail.jpg" alt="Arrival at the Centre for Alternative Technology involves ascending a mountain in a water powered funicular railway." title="Arrival at the Centre for Alternative Technology involves ascending a mountain in a water powered funicular railway."><figcaption>Arrival at the Centre for Alternative Technology involves ascending a mountain in a water powered funicular railway.</figcaption></figure><p>Clearly there is a lot of technology going on here, but it's not a computing
"tech" mode of transport like a Segway or self-driving car. If you
understand simple physics, it's easy to figure out how it works. That it runs
on water, an abundant resource in rainy Wales, means the energy cost of running
the system is very small and doesn't involve polluting the environment
(rather, it complements and integrates the ambient environmental conditions).</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa6/the_lake.jpg" alt="The lake at the top of the railway is the source of the water." title="The lake at the top of the railway is the source of the water."><figcaption>The lake at the top of the railway is the source of the water.</figcaption></figure><p>I like this enlarged view of technology, beyond just the thing being imagined
or a "tech" mode of creation.</p>
<p>Sustainability, impact and
the life-cycle of the "tech" is carefully considered. This is a very
different approach to "smaller, faster, cheaper" gizmos and apps inflicted upon
"consumers", created and made with a development process based on the mantra of
"<a href="https://xkcd.com/1428/">move fast and break things</a>",
whose aim is to maximise shareholder profit. Put simply, there is a
philosophical aspect to tech that is, in my experience, often missing or
actively discouraged in "tech" culture.</p>
<p>And so, we chose to take part in the guided tour because we wanted to see and
hear about the centre from our guide: someone intimate with the ethos and
practicalities of such an enlarged outlook to technology.</p>
<p>Despite being
semi-regular visitors over the past 27 years or more, both Mary and I learned
so much from our guide, Joel, who patiently fielded questions and engaged our
group both with the story of CAT and the various things found therein (such as
modular <a href="http://www.segalselfbuild.co.uk">Segal method</a> buildings, or the
diverse number of energy solutions, such as the hydroelectric
generator shown below).</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa6/water_power.jpg" alt="The hydroelectric generator." title="The hydroelectric generator."><figcaption>The flow of water from the top lake to the lake used by the railway drives the hydroelectric generator.</figcaption></figure><p>CAT is a very stimulating and eye-opening place, with much of the location taken over with
practical educational projects that both illustrate and explain the many
aspects of "alternative" technology.</p>
<p>As a teacher, I enjoyed their approach to engaging with folks wishing to learn.
Rather than a "how to use" video or documentation that fills your head with
facts, we were left to experiment
and engage directly with "alternative" tech. For instance, the
wind-powered seat (shown below), beautifully illustrated how little wind is
needed to achieve some useful end (in this case, lift and lower a person).</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa6/wind_powered_chair.jpg" alt="A wind powered chair that moves up and down." title="A wind powered chair that moves up and down."><figcaption>A wind powered chair gently moves the occupant up and down.</figcaption></figure><p>What you don't see in this photograph of me sitting on the chair, is the
relatively small windmill attached by a pulley system to the seat. I have to
say this was a pleasantly gentle and rather fun way to prove a point.</p>
<p>Architecture is also an important aspect of CAT, with many of the buildings
demonstrating interesting approaches to creating space for living, working and
enjoying life. Often unusual but sustainably sourced
materials are used (straw bale, or rammed earth for instance) and those aspects
of the building are thoughtfully brought to visitor's attention.</p>
<p>CAT is also a thriving educational organisation and, while we were wandering
the site, we noticed groups of students learning about "alternative" technology
in buildings built with such technology, created by the folks running the
educational programme.</p>
<p>I rather like the directness of this approach. If I were
a student looking to engage with these things, who wouldn't want to learn in
such a way?</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa6/conference_centre.jpg" alt="The sustainably built conference and education centre." title="The sustainably built conference and education centre."><figcaption>The sustainably designed and built conference and education centre.</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, CAT isn't just about "alternative" tech, but also contains information
about alternative uses of "traditional" tech. For instance, as a
space-nut, I was fascinated by their interactive display on using small earth
observation satellites to gather data and monitor changes in the landscape.
Space bound technology is no longer just the preserve of large governmental
agencies like NASA, and the open data received can be put to all sorts of
interesting and important uses.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa6/earth_observation_sat.jpg" alt="A small earth observation satellite." title="A small earth observation satellite."><figcaption>A small earth observation satellite.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're ever in mid-Wales, I heartily recommend CAT. Mary and I have always
had thought provoking visits.
Clearly CAT won't appeal to everyone, but nobody can ignore their hard work to
promote a much needed different perspective... an alternative vision of
"technology".</p>
