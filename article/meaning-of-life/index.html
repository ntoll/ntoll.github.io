<p>In my experience, "what is the meaning of life?" is viewed as a difficult
question. Nothing could be further from the truth, so let's just get
to the answer shall we?</p>

<p>We're simply asking in the wrong way. Instead of wondering what
<em>something is</em>, we can flip the question around and ask <em>what its
opposite isn't</em>. Ergo, honestly listing the reasons for not killing
yourself tells you what gives meaning to your life.</p>

<p>Try it for yourself!</p>

<p>Obviously, the answer is different for each of us and changes over time. But
that's essentially it: asking the meaning of life is solved with a glib
philosopher's dinner party trick.</p>

<p>Didn't I tell you to file this under Nicholas-is-a-smart-arse?!?!</p>

<p>"Wait a minute..." I hear you ask, "there must be more to it than that! What
about deep stuff like God?"</p>

<p>Yes, what about God?</p>

<p>I am an atheist and find it hard to discuss "God" seriously. To give you a
flavour of what I mean (and I'm certainly not trying to be disrespectful here)
when discussing religion please replace "God" with
"<a href="http://www.venganza.org/about/open-letter/">flying spaghetti
monster</a>" and "heaven" with
"<a href="http://www.orwelltoday.com/orwellreligion.shtml">Sugarcandy
Mountain</a>". If the result starts to sound silly, then you have a sense
of how all religious discussion sounds to me.</p>

<p>Given that I'm a smart-arse, perhaps I should top the meaning of life with
proof that there is no god.</p>

<p>Actually, I don't have to because the burden of proof is not my
responsibility ~ it's religious people who are asserting something (that there
is a god).</p>

<p>Let's play another word replacement game to illustrate what I mean: where a
religious person might say "God" let's say
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_teapot">a teapot orbiting the Sun</a>"
instead. As a result the assertion becomes "I believe there's
a teapot orbiting the Sun" to which I might reply, "oh no there isn't". The
response, "OK smart-arse, prove there is no teapot orbiting the Sun" shows
how bonkers and untenable such a position is. Any reasonable
person would expect the person making such assertions to be the one to prove
there is a teapot orbiting the Sun, rather than waiting for me to prove there
isn't such celestial brewing equipment. Put simply, just because it's possible
to assert something that is blatantly unverifiable doesn't make it true.</p>

<p>My favourite example of this phenomenon is a drogulus ~ an entity whose
presence is unverifiable, because it has no physical effects. The atheist
philosopher
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Ayer">A.J.Ayer</a>
coined it as a way of ridiculing the belief system of his friend, the Jesuit
philosopher,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Copleston">Frederick
Copleston</a>.</p>

<p>In 1949 Ayer and Copleston took part in a radio debate about the existence of
God. The debate then went back and forth, until Ayer came up with the following
as a way of illustrating the point that Copleston's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics">metaphysics</a>
had no content
because there was no way of testing the truth of metaphysical assertions. He
said:</p>

<blockquote>"I say, 'There's a "drogulus" over there,' and you say, 'What?' and
I say, 'drogulus' and you say 'What's a drogulus?' Well, I say, 'I can't
describe what a drogulus is, because it's not the sort of thing you can see or
touch, it has no physical effects of any kind, but it's a disembodied
being.' And you say, 'Well how am I to tell if it's there or it's not
there?' and I say, 'There's no way of telling. Everything's just the same
if it's there or it's not there. But the fact is it's there. There's a
drogulus there standing just behind you, spiritually behind you.' Does that
makes sense?"</blockquote>

<p>Of course, the natural answer Ayer was waiting for was "No, of course it
doesn't make sense." Therefore, the implication would be that metaphysics is
like the "drogulus" ~ a being which cannot be seen and has no perceptible
effects. If Ayer can get to that point, he can claim that any kind of belief
in the Christian God or in metaphysical principles in general is really
contrary to our logical and scientific understanding of the world.</p>

<p>So, what am I saying?</p>

<p>That is a complicated question - it's not just synonymous for "what is my
argument?".</p>

<p>The examples above demonstrate that language is a source of confusion.
It's possible to ask, "what am I saying?" in a more fundamental way -
synonymous with "what do words mean?". Habit or familiarity appear
to lead to lazy thinking: some <em>thing</em> must be true because it's
repeated in such-and-such a way by lots of people. Yet, <em>when the way that
thing is expressed in language is explored it becomes obvious it's actually
confused and a tad silly</em>.</p>

<p>Ask yourself, what is the <em>meaning</em> of "life"? (Or any other word or
turn of phrase.)</p>

<p>So, what's my argument? ;-)</p>

<p>If language is such a blunt tool and endless source of confusion how are we
to discuss important subjects such as how to lead a good life? How
are we to share complex and confusing ideas such as our dreams, loves and
losses?</p>

<p>I'm not sure.</p>

<p>It might be best to merely act, observe, reflect and adjust. Know me
by what I do, how I act and the way that I change myself rather than by what I
might say (to be clear, the content of this article is covered by this
assertion).</p>

<p>Like I said, file this under Nicholas-is-a-smart-arse.</p>

<p>As always, I'd love feedback, constructive critique and ideas about such
raw thoughts.</p>
