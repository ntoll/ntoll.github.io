	<p>This month's issue of <a href="http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/">Linux Format</a> magazine features some work of mine: The <a href="http://www.ntoll.org/static/files/sgftp.pdf">Guide for the Perplexed</a> &#8211; a small e-book for those wishing to get started with Linux.</p>

	<p>They describe it as:</p>

	<blockquote>

		<p><em>"... an excellent introduction to Linux [...] a great guide. It's 70 pages of easy-to-read text, along with some excellent screenshots."</em></p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>In 2002 I moved to Shropshire in order to start an MSc in Computing at a local university. One of the first things I did was seek out my local LUG (Linux User Group) to meet like minded technophiles. </p>

	<p>Soon after joining I wrote the <a href="http://www.ntoll.org/static/files/sgftp.pdf">Guide for the Perplexed</a> for new Linux users and beginner members of the group. Unfortunately, it is very out-of-date and should be revised to include the latest-and-greatest developments. </p>

	<p>Perhaps when I get more time&#8230; (the source file for OpenOffice can be found <a href="http://www.ntoll.org/static/files/sgftp.odt">here</a>)</p>
