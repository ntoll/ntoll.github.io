    <p>Last week was <a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/">PyCon UK 2017</a>. It was
perhaps the best PyCon yet and, as usual, I met many old friends and made
plenty of new ones. Many thanks to Peter Inglesby (chair) and the other
volunteers who put so much work into making this such a wonderful space for
bringing together a community.</p>

<p>A highlight of the conference for me was the number of young people who were
<strong>not part of the young coders' day</strong> but who were attending the
conference as regular attendees (and accompanied by ever-supportive
parents). I got chatting to one such combination of young person and
accompanying parent and they asked for advice on how to develop as
a beginner programmer in the Python community.</p>

<p>What follows is based upon my response:</p>

<p>What you get out of the Python community is directly related to how
much you put in. The Python community has a huge number of interesting projects
with which you could engage and learn from.</p>

<p>Put simply, look for a project that you find interesting and start to
contribute.</p>

<p>Don't dive in and submit thousands of lines of code - rather, do something
small, easy and/or trivial. It'll introduce you to the current maintainers of
the project and demonstrate you're competent while allowing you to get used to
their modus operandi. Be polite and ask questions that demonstrate you've read
their documentation.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid to ask questions - good developers are
always asking questions. Knowing how to ask and what the right questions are is
an essential skill to develop. <strong>Asking questions is NOT a sign you
don't know what you're doing</strong>. To good developers it's evidence
that you're exploring the problem and a signal that you're engaged and
interested.</p>

<p>To be clear, it takes time to get involved in a project and the quickest
way is often to take small (but secure) steps. Your collaborators, if they're
any good, will provide advice about your contributions. This is invaluable
mentorship and it also means you'll get to know people in the community. When
you go to conferences, you'll have allies and colleagues!</p>

<p>Be careful to separate criticism of your code from criticism of you. The
very best developers are humble, listen to advice and understand that code can
always be improved. Sometimes it's hard to hear that your code is not very
good, but this also helps us to appreciate how to give good (constructive)
advice.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if you don't get support, if people are rude or there's a bad
smell around the project, just leave. Life is too short to have to deal with
idiots, and if you have no choice, find experienced, thoughtful and
conscientious allies to help support you (you'll find plenty of them in the
Python community).</p>

<p>A good project will have a code of conduct that sets expectations of how
collaborators are to interact. <strong>This is far more important than
you may at first realise</strong> and, happily, many in the Python community
take this aspect of programming very seriously.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, one of the best activities to help you learn new things
is to teach. Being able to explain things indicates you know the craft of
programming at a deep level. For example, you appreciate what to leave in or
how much to leave out of an explanation. You have clear enough mental models
of the concepts of programming that you can accurately analogize and
summarise. Furthermore, to explain yourself in simple and easy-to-understand
language demonstrates your own clarity of thought. Perhaps most importantly,
finding the opportunities to practice the skill of teaching is a sign of
moral and professional value: you're putting something back into the wider
community and you have shown initiative.</p>

<p>Our community is at its best when people take the time to create a space
where others, no matter their background or differences, can flourish
together. You should endeavour to follow this example. Why? Because inclusion
that celebrates difference and diversity exercises our capacity for empathy
and understanding of others' lives, problems and interests. As a developer,
how can you be sure what people need from your software? Only by listening to
others, reflecting, evaluating and experimenting is such valuable knowledge
revealed. Only then will you know what important problems to solve.
<strong>This is (also) far more important than you may at first
realise</strong>.</p>

<p>Finally, make sure you're having fun. Writing code is often a very
frustrating activity, but when you make something work, the elation at seeing
something you've created solve a problem makes all the hours of frustration
worth it.</p>
