    <p>I had a wonderful time at <a href="https://ep2022.europython.eu/">EuroPython</a>, last
week, in Dublin.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of the conference, for me personally, involved giving
my talk entitled "Music and Code". It was an opportunity for me to reveal and
explore how I feel about programming, teaching and learning and the place of
tech in our wider culture. I've wanted to give a talk like this for over ten
years, but only recently have I figured out how to express what I wanted to say
through music as a metaphor.</p>
<div class="video-container">

</div>

<p>Another important aspect of the conference was friendship and it was a huge
pleasure to be a small part of the organising team.</p>
<p>I especially
want to highlight collaborating with <a href="https://blog.europython.eu/humans-of-europython-vicky/">Vicky</a>
(a remarkable friend who embodies so many of the wonderful aspects of our
Python community: a pro-active "can do" attitude, an inclusive and
compassionate outlook towards others, and a formidable determination to
thoughtfully do "the right thing" for the benefit of the whole community). The
two of us flapped and faffed to fulfil a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture">Maker</a> space within EuroPython.
Given the amount of positive engagement from attendees, I hope this becomes a
regular feature of the conference. A case in point being the DIY robots
competing to solve a maze in the fastest time, organised by the energetic and
enthusiastic folks at the <a href="http://niraspberryjam.com/">Northern Ireland Jam</a>:</p>

</div>

<p>I also want to mention <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/boyang-dou/">Raquel</a>, who
chaired this year's EuroPython. Her clear leadership, <em>from the front</em>, her
apparently infinite energy, <em>displayed through her considerable efforts</em>, and
her humane connection with folks, <em>embodied by her patience, friendliness and
compassion</em> are generous gifts she has shared with us all. I sincerely hope
she's taking some post-conference time off, and I want to thank her for
reaching out to me, all those months ago, to become a part of organising
EuroPython. And I have to say all my fellow organisers were an absolute joy to
work with. Their collective courtesy, hard work, enthusiasm and friendliness is
a very rare and special thing that I hope we can sustain, nourish and
cultivate.</p>
<p>One other group of friends deserves a mention - my fellow maintainers of
<a href="https://codewith.mu/">the Mu code editor</a>. It was a huge amount of fun for us
to be together in the same place for the first time ever. I was especially
delighted to meet <a href="https://github.com/xbecas">Vasco</a>, face to face, for the
first time.</p>
<p>The final part of EuroPython were two days of "code sprints", where open-source
collaborators work together on their projects, meet to discuss technical and
other aspects of our collective work, and welcome new collaborators and friends
to our efforts. We, the maintainers of Mu, had a wonderful time focusing on
Mu related things, and collaborating with new contributors who have made
welcome enhancements to Mu.</p>
<p>Here's a picture of all the Mu maintainers at EuroPython:</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/mu_maintainers.jpg" alt="The five core Mu maintainers" title="The five core Mu maintainers"><figcaption>The five core Mu maintainers:
<a href="https://github.com/tjguk">Tim</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tmontes">Tiago</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/carlosperate">Carlos</a>,
myself and
<a href="https://github.com/xbecas">Vasco</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, I heard many wonderful talks, enjoyed the conversations with many
friends old and new in the famous corridor track and took part in some really
stimulating workshops (with my amazing daughter, who was attending her first
PyCon as a proper attendee with an interest in data science - she especially
enjoyed both
<a href="https://djangogirls.org/en/dublin/">Django Girls</a> and
<a href="https://ep2022.europython.eu/humble-data">Humble Data</a>).</p>
<p>I love EuroPython's culturally cosmopolitan feeling, something that's hard to
recreate at a national PyCon. I love how folks keep coming back to EuroPython,
there are people who mean a lot to me, who I only ever see at this conference.
I also love EuroPython's peripatetic nature, as a community we are welcomed to
all sorts of fun places and have an opportunity to soak up the vibe of
different countries and cultures.</p>
<p>Long may it last, and I hope to see you at next year's EuroPython.</p>
