    <p>Since we are supposed to be on a walking holiday, Mary and I decided to try
out a shorter walk, and one with which we were familiar, on day 7. We were in
Mary's part of the world (the beautiful Shropshire hills) and so we found
ourselves driving to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiperstones">Stiperstones</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa7/stiperselfie.jpg" alt="The two of us walking along the ridge at Stiperstones." title="The two of us walking along the ridge at Stiperstones"><figcaption>The two of us on the ridge at Stiperstones.</figcaption></figure><p>We arrived relatively early in the morning and easily found a parking space,
gingerly put on our boots and started to make our ascent. Given we were both
injured in some sense (me with my blisters and Mary with her knee) we went at a
slow and steady pace.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa7/stiperstones.jpg" alt="An outcrop at Stiperstones." title="An outcrop at Stiperstones"><figcaption>An outcrop at Stiperstones.</figcaption></figure><p>Once at the top of the ridge (one of the highest points in Shropshire), the
outcrops of quartzite rock make obvious waypoints for hiking. We found several
folks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering">bouldering</a> on the rock
formations and paused to watch them and take in the glorious views and drink in
the fresh clear air.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa7/underfoot.jpg" alt="Conditions underfoot at Stiperstones." title="Conditions underfoot at Stiperstones"><figcaption>Very poor conditions under foot at Stiperstones.</figcaption></figure><p>Conditions underfoot on many parts of the ridge are not good, and it's easy to
go over on one's ankle or painfully stub a toe.</p>
<p>Our slowness was thus more compounded by both the injuries and rough-shod rocks
strewn all over the paths. Yet we made progress and walked the full extent of
the ridge in glorious sunshine and accompanied by larks chirruping
away:</p>
<blockquote>
<q>He rises and begins to round,<br>
He drops the silver chain of sound<br>
Of many links without a break,<br>
In chirrup, whistle, slur and shake,<br>
All intervolvâ€™d and spreading wide,<br>
Like water-dimples down a tide<br>
Where ripple ripple overcurls<br>
And eddy into eddy whirls;</q><br><br><cite><a href="https://allpoetry.com/The-Lark-Ascending">The Lark Ascending</a> ~ George Meredith</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>All told we walked almost five miles:</p>
<div id="map-day7" style="height: 400px"></div>

<p>In the afternoon we visited the small town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop's_Castle">Bishop's Castle</a>,
having heard the high street contained a number of book shops and a
<a href="https://poetrypharmacy.co.uk/">Poetry Pharmacy</a>, which sounded like it was
just what we needed.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa7/bishops-castle.jpg" alt="Bishop's Castle high street." title="Bishop's Castle high street."><figcaption>The high street at Bishop's Castle - including a poetry pharmacy.</figcaption></figure><p>In the end we spent most of our time in the wonderful <a href="https://www.hocmuseum.org.uk/">House on Crutches Museum</a>
where I was able to examine some of the old brass instruments from the former
town band (not in a good state), and learn all about local
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_dance">Morris dancing</a> troupes.</p>
<p>The poetry pharmacy was another highlight, although I was unable to find
anything to read that suited my mood. Perhaps, given that I usually have my
nose in a book, this holiday is also a holiday from reading.</p>
<p>In the evening we stayed near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welshpool">Welshpool</a>
and found evidence of the local knitting circle's guerilla Easter decoration
operation:</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa7/welshpool.jpg" alt="Easter knitting in Welshpool." title="Easter knitting in Welshpool."><figcaption>Easter knitting in Welshpool.</figcaption></figure><p>The next day started with a drive to lake Vyrnwy (you pronounce it,
"ver-in-wee"). The lake is man-made and to reach the car park involves crossing
this rather imposing dam.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa7/vyrnwy-dam.jpg" alt="The dam at Lake Vyrnwy." title="The dam at Lake Vyrnwy."><figcaption>The imposing dam at Lake Vyrnwy.</figcaption></figure><p>We timed our arrival perfectly since the car park was empty and hardly anyone
appeared to be around.</p>
<p>We decided to walk around the lake until we found a quiet beach on which we
could sit, relax and simply ponder the world. It can't have taken more than 20
minutes to find such an isolated spot, and we spent over two hours just
chatting, relaxing or throwing skimmers into the lake.</p>
<p>Over the course of the morning we were joined by various passers-by: a young
family, a Polish couple with their daughter, a group of students. Everyone was
friendly and happy to be by the lakeside and the opportunity for moments of
reflection that it offered.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa7/lake-vyrnwy.jpg" alt="Lake Vyrnwy." title="Lake Vyrnwy."><figcaption>Lake Vyrnwy.</figcaption></figure><p>On our walk back to the car we appeared to meet a bank holiday weekend tour for
the "young fellers with souped-up cars" motoring club. The sound of noisy
exhausts, the look of go-faster stripes and the thinness of sports tyres
(clearly, for country roads) were much in evidence. A massive traffic jam was
also in evidence as the posse (what is the correct plural noun?) of young men
in souped up cars, took on the overweight hairy bikers and caravan owners in a
three way battle for the junction leading to the dam. It wasn't a pretty sight
as helpful bikers attempted to direct the traffic, only to be ignored by one of
the other tribes (in the end, the old fellers just stood in the way of the
traffic to control the flow). Well, done to the hairy bikers for their public
service!</p>
<p>We took our time getting back to the car, not wishing to be involved in the
traffic chaos, but in the end the blockages had been cleared and the route to
the dam was clear.</p>
<p>We ended up driving to our overnight rest stop at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llanymynech">Llanymynech</a>
and spent some time exploring the remains of the lime industry in the area.
This included a lovely walk in some woods reclaiming the area used for
processing and delivering treated lime into barges on the Shropshire Union
canal. Among the thickets we found a huge abandoned lime kiln.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa7/lime-kilns.jpg" alt="Lime kilns in Llanymynech." title="Lime kilns in Llanymynech."><figcaption>Lime kilns in Llanymynech.</figcaption></figure><p>Today started with a trip to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirk_Castle">Chirk Castle</a>.</p>
<p>As members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Trust">National Trust</a>
we got in for free and spent the morning wandering the amazing gardens and
grounds.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa7/chirk_castle.jpg" alt="Chirk Castle." title="Chirk Castle."><figcaption>Chirk Castle.</figcaption></figure><p>The gardens ranged from managed woodland to formal gardens with statues and
topiary.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa7/chirk_formal_gardens.jpg" alt="Chirk gardens." title="Chirk gardens."><figcaption>Chirk gardens.</figcaption></figure><p>Inside the castle were displays depicting different aspects of the castle's
history, including the dungeon, the clockwork for the clock tower, the
servant's hall and a collection of knight's helmets. These final items made
me smile, as each helmet appears to bear a different expression, much like a
medieval metal emoji.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa7/helmet_emoji.jpg" alt="A selection of knight's helmets." title="A selection of knight's helmets."><figcaption>A selection of knight's helmets.</figcaption></figure><p>In the afternoon we visited the town of Llangollen. It being bank holiday
Monday, the small town was heaving with visitors (like us) and the tourist
traps were doing a swift trade.</p>
<p>A highlight was watching canoeists tackle the Dee river running through the
town (they had hung slalom gates over the river). This led us to the railway
station, run by volunteer enthusiasts, and we ended up escaping the scrum of
tourists by taking a trip up the valley in an open train to the village of
Berwyn.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa7/llangollen.jpg" alt="The river Dee at Llangollen." title="The river Dee at Llangollen."><figcaption>The river Dee at Llangollen.</figcaption></figure><p>As we enter the final stretch of our holiday, we're both starting to feel like
all this relaxing and touring is quite tiring. It means our holiday has done
its job: we're looking forward to throwing ourselves back into our usual day to
day routines.</p>
