<h3>Why Computers Work (part 5)</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images">The Treachery of Images</a>
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Magritte">René Magritte</a> is a
thought provoking visual brain twist. It shows a pipe, under which is written
in French, "this is not a pipe". Magritte is correct, it is <em>not</em> a pipe, but
actually a painting:</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/treachery_of_images.jpg" alt="This is not a painting"><figcaption><a href="https://www.lacma.org/art/exhibition/magritte-and-contemporary-art-treachery-images" target="_blank">Source</a> - educational fair use.
</figcaption></figure><p>In a similar vein, you're not currently looking at a painting ~ rather, you're
looking at a multitude of pixels, each one acting like a small tile in a huge
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_mosaic">mosaic</a> containing millions of
tesserae, each tile being one of many millions of possible colours. If you were
to zoom into the image you'd see something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="This is still not a painting" src="../../images/treachery_of_zoom.jpg"></p>
<p>Yet, you're not even looking at an assortment of tessellated pixels! Rather,
your screen actually consists of repeating cells, each in turn split
into red, green and blue (RGB) sections. If you used a magnifying glass
to look at your screen, you'd see something similar to this:</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/treachery_of_pixels.jpg" alt="This is definitely not a painting"><figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LCD_pixels_on_Acer_Extensa_5620Z_20090124.jpg" target="_blank">Source</a> - Licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en" target="_blank">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>.
</figcaption></figure><p>The upper half of the image contains blocks of the RGB cells arranged to
display the basic colours: red, green and blue. The lower half contains RGB
cells arranged into two blocks for white and black. By adjusting the amount
of constituent red, green and blue emitted in each individual RGB cell, many
millions of colours can be generated. If you step back from your screen,
squint your eyes and look at the blocks of colour you'll see this effect in
action.</p>
<p>For completeness, here's a close-up of one of the individual RGB cells:</p>
<p><img alt="An RGB square pixel" src="../../images/rgb_pixel.jpg"></p>
<p>There are likely to be several hundred of these minute electrical components
per square-inch of the screen you're using to read this article.</p>
<p>Our perception of what we encounter depends on its scale. Furthermore, what
we
encounter may not be what we see, as René Magritte forces us to acknowledge
with The Treachery of Images (we see a pipe when we're actually encountering a
painting, or pixels, or a screen, and so on). There is a
<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/" target="_blank">phenomenological</a>
aspect to our relationship to things: we can't help but add meaning coloured by
our unique experience of the world. We have a unique and personal
perspective.</p>

<p>This applies to other encounters with the world too.</p>
<p>Our perception of time depends on a sense of scale or, perhaps more
accurately, tempo. Each of the following eight images shows a different
snapshot of a stick man.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/running_frames.png" alt="Individual frames for a running stick figure animation"><figcaption><a href="https://steemit.com/art/@magiccleatus/magiccleatus-animates-2d-running-stickman-an-animated-template" target="_blank">Source</a> - educational fair use.
</figcaption></figure><p>Yet if we repeatedly and speedily place them on top of each other, we no longer
see eight individual images, but a single image <strong>in motion</strong>. In fact, because
we can't help but add meaning, we see a stick man running.</p>
<p><img alt="Running stick man animation" src="../../images/running.gif"></p>
<p>Scale also effects other senses, such as our perception of sound. Consider the
following musical experiment:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._9_(Beethoven)">Beethoven's mighty 9th Symphony</a>
stretched to last twenty-four hours. By drastically slowing down the tempo (all
other aspects of the piece remaining the same ~ notes, instrumentation, and so
on), it becomes something completely different. It sounds like an ambient
musical experiment by the likes of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno">Brian Eno</a> and our recognition of
melody, form or harmonic structure disintegrates - even though the original
melody, form and harmonic structures are still present. Such a temporal zoom,
as well as hiding aspects of the music, also reveals new details: I find myself
concentrating on the timbre of the instruments and enjoying the indistinct
transitions between pitches ~ it's like listening through fog.</p>

<p>Why are these examples important..?</p>
<p>In the first post I challenged you to acquire new perspectives about seemingly
everyday things. I called these brain twists because they cause "aha" moments.
Such subjective shifts provide a new, and hopefully deeper, understanding of
what we're encountering or how we relate to something. The external world
remains as it was before, but it is we who have changed perspective.</p>
<p>Yet the previous examples show brain twists are something we do naturally,
even if we're not always aware we're performing such twists. These examples
were carefully chosen because they bring such <em>changes of perspective into
focus</em>.</p>
<p>Put simply, I'm inviting you to shift <em>your</em> perspective about how <em>we change</em>
perspective. Or, put another way, can you "brain twist" brain twists..?</p>
<p>Our capacity to shift perspective due to scale is a fundamental reason <em>why</em>
computers appear to work. They work so fast at such a small scale that our
sense of time and space means we don't see our computer re-drawing a static
image on a flat screen made up of millions of RGB cells at a rate of around 64
images per second. Rather, we see this blog post consisting of words, images,
sound and video - things that are meaningful to us. The computer is working at
a completely different scale of time (3 billion instructions a second), space
(running on microscopic electrical components) and with an absence of meaning
(it's just physics relating to electrical circuits). Yet you understand the
words, appreciate the images and engage with the music in this blog post: you
bring your unique culturally informed and meaningful perspective to the human
scale of things.</p>
<p>Here's the brain twist: such tricks of perspective due to scale <em>also apply to
thinking</em>.</p>
<p>Consider learning to ride a bike ~ it's a challenge because the learner has to
think about lots of different things at once. For instance, turning the pedals,
steering, keeping balance, posture, the brakes and coordinating all these
things together so the beginner cyclist moves safely in the right direction.
When we become proficient at cycling, this bundle of thinking simply becomes
"riding a bike". All the constituent aspects I describe above are subsumed into
a larger concept.</p>
<p>Such diverse dexterous details, through careful practice and familiarity,
become a single named activity. In a sense, we have zoomed out in the scale of
our thinking. Such generalisations are useful as placeholders in further
thoughts... the building blocks of our generalised thinking are at a
<em>different scale</em>.</p>
<p>For instance, I could say "I'm just going to cycle to the shops, do you want me
to get anything for you?". The concept of <em>cycling to the shops</em> is a place
holder for the rather complicated activity of riding a bike, but whose specific
details are not important for the meaning of the sentence.</p>
<p>This is, in a computing sense, what we mean by "abstraction".</p>
<p>In this sense of "abstraction", functional units that fulfil a certain role are
organised into larger, or are composed of yet smaller, functional units. Such
units are used together to achieve some valuable end when their relative scale
allows complementary usage.</p>
<p>Because computers process billions of instructions a second, this hierarchy of
abstraction is hidden in the blink of an eye with the end result being
something comprehensible at our human scale (except when things go wrong and
the computer becomes incomprehensible or appears confused...  commonly known as
a bug).</p>
<p>Often the skill of the programmer or engineer is to work out the arrangement
and coordination of such abstractions to achieve something meaningful at the
human scale.</p>
<p>A wonderful visual example of such an arrangement and coordination of
abstraction is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Conway's Game of Life</a>.</p>

<p>The Game of Life is an automata: rules that define a process for how certain
states of affairs transition to a new state (sound familiar?). In the case of
the Game of Life, the states of affairs describe a huge grid. Each square cell
in the grid can be alive (white) or dead (black). Another way to imagine the
Game of Life is as many parallel tapes lined up on a huge Turing machine with
some squares white (on) and others black (off).</p>
<p>There are only three rules to work out the next state of affairs, and they are
disarmingly simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.</li>
<li>Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.</li>
<li>All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead
   cells stay dead.</li>
</ol>
<p>It feels as if nothing of much interest could be made with such a game. But
consider the following Game of Life grid state:</p>
<table class="tape life">
<tr>
<td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td class="on"></td>
        <td class="on"></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
    </tr>

        <td> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>

        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td> </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>By following the simple rules, the next state of affairs <em>must</em> look like
this (pick a white cell from the first grid, follow the rules in your head, and
work out if you agree with this second grid):</p>
<table class="tape life">
<tr>
<td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td> </td>
        <td> </td>
        <td> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td> </td>
        <td> </td>
        <td> </td>
        <td> </td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
        <td> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td> </td>
        <td> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>Of course, this grid can transition to a further new state of affairs (notice
anything interesting? It's an upside-down version of the first grid, but moved
one cell to the left and one cell up):</p>
<table class="tape life">
<tr>
<td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td class="on"></td>
        <td class="on"></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td class="on"> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td> </td>
        <td> </td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>The next state of affairs is, unsurprisingly, the same as the second state but
upside down:</p>
<table class="tape life">
<tr>
<td></td>
        <td class="on"></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td class="on"></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td class="on"> </td>
        <td> </td>
        <td> </td>
        <td> </td>
        <td> </td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td class="on"> </td>
        <td> </td>
        <td> </td>
        <td> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td class="on"> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td class="on"> </td>
        <td> </td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>A further outcome of such mirroring is that this final state <em>must</em> transition
back to the first state of affairs but moved by one cell to the left.</p>
<p>Such an arrangement and coordination of cells, combined with the rules of
the Game of Life, create a looping pattern of four steps that always moves in a
single direction until it bumps into another pattern of cells. It appears to
humans as if something is flying across the grid of squares (which is why this
pattern is called
<a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Spaceship" target="_blank">a
spaceship</a>).</p>

<p>Skilful combination and arrangement of such small groups of cells in the Game
of Life show how abstraction, scale and perspective interact. In the following
video, as the camera zooms out the tempo of change speeds up to reveal
structures within structures, and something rather amazing.</p>
<div class="video-container">

</div>

<p>A similar stack of abstraction is required for you to read this blog post
on <em>your computer</em>.</p>

<p>My website is created using an easy-to-read-and-write programming language
called <a href="https://python.org" target="_blank">Python</a>. Python is,
itself, written in another programming language called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" target="_blank">C</a>.
C is less easy to read but still comprehensible to a trained software engineer.
Yet C has to be
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler" target="_blank">compiled</a>
for it to work. When C code is compiled, the relatively understandable C code
is translated into instructions written in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language" target="_blank">assembly language</a>,
that work in a way that is closer to how the circuitry of the computer works.
But we're not finished yet..! The assembly language is itself translated into
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code" target="_blank">machine code</a>,
a representation of assembly language instructions as binary numbers. This is
the lowest level software engineers tend to go when it comes to zooming-in to
the computer. But the numeric machine code instructions physically stored on
the computer hardware are usually further refined into
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcode" target="_blank">microcode</a>
- a series of circuit-level instructions that describe how the hardware should
behave to complete the computation. Of course, someone will have organised and
designed the millions of transistors and other microscopic components that make
up the (<a href="../why-computers-4/">Turing complete</a>) hardware. This
is the level of computing at which electrical engineers, chip designers and,
ultimately, physicists can be found.</p>

<p>Along the way, I didn't have to write everything from scratch. Coders use
<a href="https://pypi.org/" target="_blank">software libraries</a> in the same
way a chef may re-use pre-existing recipes. Someone else will have figured out
how to do some valuable task and organised the steps needed to fulfil it into,
say, <a href="https://arrr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">a module
of re-usable Python code</a>. Just like the bundle of thinking needed
to ride a bike becomes subsumed into the concept of cycling, I don't have to
know the implementation details, but can refer to the relevant re-usable code
when it is needed in my own program. Such re-use of existing instructions
happens in all the levels of the computing <em>stack</em> I describe above.</p>

<p>All these levels of abstraction are required to get to this fragment of Python:</p>
<p><img alt="Hello World in Python" src="../../images/hello_world.gif"></p>
<p>As I come to the end of this exploration of computing, I can't help but feel
there is one final brain twist ~ something missing or yet undiscovered about
our relationship with computers.</p>
<p>To use a musical metaphor, I feel like I've explained why a piano works (the
tuning, acoustic properties, action of the keyboard and hammers) and shown why
this relates to musical theory. Yet I've said nothing about the art or
performance of music, the emotions we feel when we hear or play music, or
that music moves us at a fundamental and human level.</p>
<p>We are missing the "music" of computers (and we miss it at our peril).</p>
<p>Wittgenstein best sums up my feeling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Die Menschen, die immerfort ›warum‹ fragen, sind wie die Touristen, die, im
<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baedeker-Reisef%C3%BChrer">Bädeker</a> lesend,
vor einem Gebäude stehen &amp; durch das Lesen der Entstehungsgeschichte etc etc
daran gehindert werden, das Gebäude zu <em>sehen</em>.</p>
<p>(People who are constantly asking 'why' are like tourists, who stand in front
of a building, reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baedeker">Baedeker</a>, &amp;
through reading about the history of the building's construction etc etc are
prevented from <em>seeing</em> it.)</p>
<p>~ Ludwig Wittgenstein, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_and_Value">Culture and Value</a> (MS 124:93)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should, rightly, be amazed by the technical marvel of computers; but it
is all too easy to be overwhelmed by, and focus on, the apparent cleverness (or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine" target="_blank">Rube Goldberg</a>-iness)
of it all. Sadly, in so doing we miss the opportunity for an enlarged, more
creative and expressive encounter with computing.</p>

<p>Computers are not just machines for rapidly evaluating logical instructions.
They are a medium through which we share and express our values, culture,
social world and forms of life. They are only valuable because we are able to
create and express things of significance <em>through computers</em>. Furthermore,
<em>the way we express things with computers</em>, and <em>that we choose this form of
expression</em> is also of cultural significance. Like other forms of creative 
endeavour, computers reflect those who make, inhabit and consume in such a
medium.</p>
<p>Computers shine when they enlarge us in an affirmative, fulfilling, humane,
creative and expressive way. Yet computing for the sake of computers, with no
regard for culture, is a diminished, inhumane and insular form of ignorance
and, sadly, I can't help but feel disappointed with how, in the mainstream, we
currently use and think of computers.</p>
<p>Social media is anything but social... it's an efficient advertising laboratory
that turns humanity into lab rats caged in echo chambers of digitally digested
packets of small-mindedness. "Artificial intelligence", "machine learning",
"blockchain" and other such buzzwords are nerdy PR for the clever use of
computers to unsatisfactorily automate human activity (including our latent
prejudices). Computer games are mostly beautiful looking yet formulaic
variations on a theme, target driven and hardly allow a player to express
themselves. Our world is polluted by complicated and unpleasant computerised
gizmos: "intelligent" washing machines, programmable coffee makers, automatic
point-of-sale machines... most of which are banal or frustrating to use. And,
of course, no aspect of life is too small to be "solved" by an app available on
your mobile device (a perculiarly problematic outlook ~ it's as if we're all
broken and need technology to fix us).</p>
<p>Such a shallow, invasive and unfulfilling world of computing is perhaps
inevitable. It reflects our failure to think creatively while we focus on
automating things in the most trivial, complicated or inconvenient manner. Yet
highlighting such a problematic state of affairs is helpful, for then we can
compensate and re-balance.</p>
<p>Personally, I can't help but feel the missing part of our relationship with
computers is an emphasis on things like culture, contemplation and creativity ~
activities and aspects of our lives that are affirmative, healing, empowering,
raise up our existence or provoke useful reflection and personal growth.</p>
<p>The final brain twist I have for you is to rise above a merely technical view
of computers. I hope you imagine, create and participate in a meaningful,
authentic and engaging culture expressed with and through computers. One in
which computers become a medium for
<a href="https://democracyclub.org.uk/" target="_blank">affirmative</a>,
<a href="https://freedom.press/" target="_blank">liberating</a>
and
<a href="http://inbflat.net/" target="_blank">expressive</a>
activities that enlarge ourselves, our world and our place in it.</p>
<p>In other words, let's <a href="../on-being-together">together</a> compose the
oft-missing "music" of computing.</p>
<p>After all, we are <a href="../thought-in-motion/">only just getting started</a> with
these strange instruments of automation.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>
