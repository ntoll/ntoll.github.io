<p><strong><em>Allegory</em></strong> (<em>noun</em>) : the expression, by means of symbolic fictional
figures and actions, of truths or generalizations about human existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr class="section_break">
<p>Everyone knows the Python programming language was invented by 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> and first
revealed to the world in his 1859 magnum opus, <em>On the Origin
of Programming by Means of Natural Indentation, or the Preservation of Favoured
Algorithms in the Struggle for Resources</em>.</p>
<p>As has been copiously documented elsewhere, while Darwin suffered ridicule and
hostility from the Victorian establishment, a community of supporters emerged
to help Python reform its reputation as a programming language, achieve
widespread acceptance, and eventually become a core part of our modern
computing stack.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/early_pythians.jpg" alt="A group shot of some of the Victorian Python community." title="A group shot of some of the Victorian Python community."><figcaption>A group shot of some of the early Victorian Python community.
(<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/statelibraryqueensland/43434177381">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>This group of unnamed community organisers were responsible for some of the
first Python programming conventions and exhibitions. They eventually
instigated the Royal Society of Python (RSP) whose first patron was the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VII">Prince of Wales</a>. Even today, the
post-nominals FRSP (fellow of the Royal Society of Python) are widely
established as a much sought after recognition of professional success.</p>
<p>Of course, the earliest Python programmers were exclusively gentleman amateurs
~ men with the education and financial means to pursue an interest in
computing, for the love of it rather than for financial gain. They often met
to informally discuss their work in the coffee houses and gentlemen's
clubs of London. Such activity soon led to the formation of The Pythian Club in
1863 (the forerunner of the Royal Society of Python) and the publication of
technical papers, written by club members and published in its journal, The
Pythian Exposition Pamphlet (<a href="https://peps.python.org/">PEP</a>).</p>
<p>Much innovative and creative energy was shared in those early years. While some
of this activity addressed uniquely Victorian technology and cultural norms,
we still use a remarkable amount of code from this era. Furthermore, a
recognisably Pythonic approach and aesthetic, familiar to programmers of today,
emerged at this time.</p>
<p>Because of cultural norms rather than by design, the early Pythian Club was an
exclusively male space. However, as Python became more widely known, women
ventured into this traditionally male world. The Pythians, as they came to be
called, hoped to promote the widespread popularity and adoption of Python, so
eventually welcomed women. By 1879 up to 5% of their members were female.
Unfortunately, women often found themselves on the receiving end of the tacit
mysogyny, sexism and male chauvinism of the time. Similarly, ingrained
institutional racism and cultural prejudices also meant those from a
non-European background were often excluded, patronised or subjected to onerous
membership requirements.</p>
<p>In response, and because measuring things always reveals the right answer,
concerned Pythians collected data and published tables and charts to show how
their ranks were growing according to the sex, age, social background or
nationality of the participants.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/female_coders.jpg" alt="A chart about female coders." title="A chart about female coders."><figcaption>The Pythians produced statistics about female coders (this example
is from the 1890s). (<a href="https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1740-9713.01376">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Complementary to such data led practices, and born of a desire to improve the
moral fibre, deportment and behaviour of Pythians, the first of innumerable
versions of a code of conduct was published.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/victorian_rules.png" alt="The code of conduct." title="The code of conduct."><figcaption>One of many versions of the Victorian Python community's code of conduct.</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, a group of teachers, school inspectors and orphanage directors
worked
together with the Pythians to tackle the problems of dangerous child labour
practices, youth delinquency and sub-normal computing literacy in the general
population. An act of parliament, championed by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Russell,_1st_Earl_Russell">Lord Russell</a>
in 1876, forced all children to learn about computation with the aid of an
abacus, slide rule and clockwork calculating machine called a
<span><a href="https://microbit.org/">micro:contraption:for:computing:<wbr></wbr>splendid:results</a></span>.
Patronage of the Prince of Wales and a royal charter soon followed and the
Pythian Club became the Royal Society of Python, whose offices one can still
find on John Adam street, adjacent to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelphi,_London">the Adelphi</a>,
just off the Strand in London.</p>

<p>Enthused with successes, the Royal Society of Python organised schools for the
fortification of logical, algorithmic, inquiry and learning (the origin of the
phrase, "to flail around"), and organised a curriculum of rote learning and
regular examinations to ensure young people were equipped for, and knew their
place in the growth of the British Empire.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/children.jpg" alt="Education track." title="Education track."><figcaption>Instructions from an early Victorian Python education summit.</figcaption></figure><p>Such practices, codes of conduct and educational efforts were widely adopted.</p>
<p>Yet there were dark clouds on the horizon and such developments caused
consternation among two groups:</p>
<ol>
<li>Artistic free spirits, those of a melancholic disposition, anarchists, and
   trade unionists, who inevitably railed against the formal rules, regulations
   and processes imposed from on high.</li>
<li>Traditionalists, progressives and everyone in between, who simply disagreed
   with whatever was the current code of conduct (until it was replaced with
   <em>their own</em> version).</li>
</ol>
<p>Into this mix came further considerations: a desire that financial endowments
from the Royal Society of Python be made to the deserving poor with the right
sort of upstanding constitution, rather than to the afore mentioned artistic
types, the morally corrupt, and bothersome foreigners barging in on the
society's coding crusade for the spread of civilized indentation.</p>
<p>Some senior members of the Royal Society of Python, the very people who
organised such <em>selective grant giving efforts</em>, preached the virtues of
kindness and charity to assemblies of the Python community. Thus, they ensured
their political manoeuvers appeared ostensibly benign.</p>
<p>The situation became ugly as such members vied for power and resources within
the Royal Society of Python. Manipulative machinations, plots, gossip, self
promotion and factionalism ran rife. The Royal Society of Python was no longer
a friendly society of shared fellowship in the craft of coding. Those suspected
of straying from the conventional straight and narrow path were swiftly
condemned in the
<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/letters-to-the-editor">letters page of the London Times</a>
and subtly ostracised.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/victorian_group.png" alt="Senior members." title="Senior members."><figcaption>Senior members of the Royal Society of Python.</figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, industrialists from the north of England, seeing how lucrative
Python based produce could be, sponsored or employed senior members of the
society to advance their interests and ensure profits remained secure. They
even exerted shadowy influence within the Royal Society of Python so
competitors were excluded or disadvantaged (most notoriously, a director
of a Python-using pie making company from Cambridgeshire undermined the award
of the society's annual medal to a competitor and ensured yet another was
excluded from fully participating in society activities).</p>
<p>The fun, adventure and imaginative spark of Python's early days disappeared and
was replaced by the puritanical promotion of stifling, trite and standardised
frameworks and processes for many aspects of Python coding (from
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html">type hinting</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/">source control</a>
to the
<a href="../chicken/">writing of documentation</a>). With the encouragement of their
paymaster industrialists, some members of the society used their influence
and control to deliberately spread (insipid yet so-called) exemplary standards
of upstanding engineering practice that benefited the business interests of
their sponsor or employer. Alas, Python was widely used to create mass market,
derivative, lifeless and banal software in a race to the bottom of the coding
barrel.</p>
<p>(Urban myth tells us that a bug-ridden Python script driving a lace making 
loom got into an infinite loop, and thus the
<a href="https://www.nottinghamcastleproject.co.uk/projects/power-of-art-and-making/nottingham-lace/">Nottingham lace industry</a>
was born with a (literal) stack overflow of frilly collars, doilies, curtains,
knickers and drapes.)</p>
<p>Such sharp practices, political posturing and vapid design inevitably caused a
backlash.</p>
<p>Famously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> quipped,
"Python's not the serpent that tempted Eve", in a text penned while
incarcerated at Reading Gaol. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morris">William Morris</a>
lamented the poor quality and blandness of Pythonic creations in
his famous lecture of 1884, "How We Might Code" (further explored in his later
novel, "Code from Nowhere"). A certain
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi">Mohandas Ghandi</a>,
an Indian student studying Python at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London">University College London</a>
in the late 1880s, went on to found the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadeshi_movement">swadeshi movement</a>: a
reaction to the reliance on products produced by industrialised coding, and
whose aim was self-sufficient hand-made khodi (code). Meanwhile huge offence
was caused by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmeline_Pankhurst">Emmeline Pankhurst</a> who
dared to suggest women were as equally skilled as men at writing Python code.
Outside Britain and her dominions, the use of generative AI written in Python
was pioneered by Austro-Germanic composers such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Bruckner">Anton Bruckner</a>
("how else was he able to create so many hour-long symphonies that all sound
the same, with such regularity and in such a short space of time?" asked
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a>).</p>
<p>Inevitably, at the dawn of the 20th century, disgruntled Python coders broke
away from the troubled Royal Society of Python and formed small coding
cooperatives, guilds and workshops under the auspices of the emerging Code and
Crafts movement founded by Morris.</p>
<p>The influence of these reformers is still felt today: our more enlightened and
expressive approach to writing software, with its focus on <em>human beings</em> over
computers, <em>authentic expression in the digital realm</em> over simulated emulation
of the real world, and <em>empowering creativity through code</em> over data driven
automation, is thanks largely to the radical, risky and revolutionary (for the
time) work of such rebels.</p>
<p>Python therefore became both part of the British establishment <em>and</em> a haven
for unbound creative expression.</p>
<p>This dichotomy is best illustrated by Queen Victoria's reaction to learning of
the release of <a href="https://python.org/">Python 3</a> support for the
<a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL library</a>
(she was able to return to the development of her
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Stoker">Bram Stoker</a> inspired vampire
slaying game, an entry for <a href="https://pyweek.org/">PyWeek</a> (1898) written with
<a href="https://www.pygame.org/news">PyGame</a>).</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/mildly_amused.jpg" alt="We are mildly amused." title="We are mildly amused."><figcaption>Queen Victoria, on hearing of SDL support in Python 3, "we are

<p>As they say in the movies, this blog post was "inspired" by
<a href="../compassion/">real events</a>.</p>
<p>However, any resemblance to persons living or dead is coincidental, and any
implication that members of the Python community have a
<a href="https://pyjok.es/">sense of humour</a>,
creative spark or moral conscience about the influence of technology on society
should not be inferred.</p>
