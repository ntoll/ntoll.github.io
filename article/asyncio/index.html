    <p><a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> version 3.4 was recently released.
For me, the most interesting
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/whatsnew/3.4.html">update</a>
was the inclusion of the
<code><a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3156/">asyncio</a></code>
module. The
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio.html">documentation</a>
states it,</p>

<blockquote>...provides infrastructure for writing single-threaded concurrent
code using coroutines, multiplexing I/O access over sockets and other
resources, running network clients and servers, and other related primitives.
</blockquote>

<p>While I understand all the terminology from the documentation I don't yet
have a <em>feel</em> for the module nor do I yet comprehend when to use one
feature rather than another. Writing about this module and examining
concrete examples is my way to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok">grok</a>
<code>asyncio</code>. I'll be concise and only assume familiarity with
Python.</p>

<p>So, what is <code>asyncio</code>?</p>

<p>It's a module that enables you to write code that concurrently handles
asynchronous network based interactions.</p>

<p>What precisely do I mean?</p>

<p>Concurrency is when several things happen simultaneously. When something is
asynchronous it is literally not synchronised: there is no way to tell when
some <em>thing</em> may happen (in this case, network based I/O).
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output">I/O</a> (input/output)
is when a program communicates with the "outside world" and network based I/O
simply means the program communicates with another device (usually) on the
internet. Messages arrive and depart via the network at unpredictable times -
<code>asyncio</code> helps you write programs that deal with all these
interactions simultaneously.</p>

<p>How does it work?</p>

<p>At the core of <code>asyncio</code> is an
<a href="http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/4ab2d8fac52b/Lib/asyncio/base_events.py#l176">event loop</a>.
This is simply code that keeps looping (I'm trying to avoid the
temptation of using a racing car analogy). Each "lap" of the loop (dammit)
checks for new I/O events and does various other "stuff" that we'll come onto
in a moment. Within the <code>asyncio</code> module, the
<a href="http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/4ab2d8fac52b/Lib/asyncio/base_events.py#l761">_run_once</a>
method encapsulates a full iteration of the loop. Its documentation
explains:</p>

<blockquote>This calls all currently ready callbacks, polls for I/O,
schedules the resulting callbacks, and finally schedules
'call_later' callbacks.
</blockquote>

<p>A <em>callback</em> is code to be run when some event has occurred and
<em>polling</em> is discovering the status of something external to the
program (in this case network based I/O activity). When a small child
constantly asks, "are we there yet..?" on a long car journey, that's polling.
When the unfortunate parent replies, "I'll tell you when we arrive" they are
creating a sort of callback (i.e. they promise to do something when some
condition is met). The <code>_run_once</code> method processes the
I/O events that occurred during the time it took to complete the
<em>previous</em> "lap", ensures any callbacks that need to be run are done so
during <em>this</em> lap and carries out "housekeeping" needed for callbacks
that have <em>yet to be called</em>.</p>

<p>Importantly, the pending callbacks are executed one after the other
- stopping the loop from continuing. In other words, the next "lap" cannot
start <em>until all the sequentially executed callbacks finish</em> (in some
sense).</p>

<p>I imagine you're thinking, "Hang on, I thought you said
<code>asyncio</code> works concurrently?" I did and it does. Here's the
problem: concurrency is hard and there's more than one way to do it. So it's
worth taking some time to examine why <code>asyncio</code> works in the
way that it does.</p>

<p>If concurrent tasks interact with a shared resource they run the risk of
interfering with each other. For example, task A reads a
record, task B reads the same record, both A and B change the retrieved
record in different ways, task B writes the record, then task A writes the
record (causing the changes made by task B to be lost). Such interactions
between indeterminate
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_%28computer_science%29">threaded</a>"
tasks result in painfully hard-to-reproduce bugs and complicated
mechanisms required to mitigate such situations. This is bad because the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a> (keep it
simple, stupid) principle is abandoned.</p>

<p>One solution is to program in a synchronous manner: tasks
executed one after the other so they have no chance to interfere with
each other. Such programs are easy to understand since they're simply
a deterministic sequential list of things to do: first A, then B,
followed by C and so on. Unfortunately, if A needs to wait for something, for
example, a reply from a machine on the network, then the whole program waits.
As a result, the program can't handle any other events that may occur
while it waits for A's network call to complete - in such a case,
the program is described as
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_%28computing%29">blocked</a>".
The program becomes potentially slow and unresponsive - an unacceptable
condition if we're writing something that needs to react quickly to things
(such as a server - precisely the sort of program <code>asyncio</code> is
intended to help with).</p>

<p>Because <code>asyncio</code> is event driven, network related I/O is
<em>non-blocking</em>. Instead of waiting for a reply from a network call
before continuing with a computation, programmers define callbacks to be run
only when the result of the network call becomes known. In the meantime,
the program continues to respond to other things: the event loop keeps polling
for and responding to network I/O events (such as when the reply to our
network call arrives and the specified callbacks are executed).</p>

<p>This may sound abstract and confusing but it's remarkably close to how we
make plans in real life: when <em>X</em> happens, do <em>Y</em>. More
concretely, "when the tumble dryer finishes, fold the clothes and put them
away". Here, "the tumble dryer finishes" is some <em>event</em> we're
expecting and "fold the clothes and put them away" is a callback that
specifies what to do when the event happens. Once this plan is made, we're
free to get on with other things <em>until</em> we discover the tumble dryer
has finished.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as humans we work on concurrent tasks in a similar
non-blocking manner. We skip between the things we need to do while we wait
for other things to happen: we know we'll have time to squeeze the orange
juice while the toast and eggs are cooking when we make breakfast. Put in a
programmatic way, execute B while waiting on the result of the network call
made by A.</p>

<p><img src="http://ntoll.org/static/images/breakfast.jpg" alt="Orange juice, toast and eggs"></p>

<p>Such familiar concepts mean <code>asyncio</code> avoids potentially
confusing and complicated "threaded" concurrency while retaining the benefits
of strictly sequential code. In fact, the
<a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3156/">specification</a> for
<code>asyncio</code> states that callbacks are,</p>

<blockquote>[...] strictly serialized: one callback must finish before the
next one will be called. This is an important guarantee: when two or more
callbacks use or modify shared state, each callback is guaranteed that while
it is running, the shared state isn't changed by another callback.
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, from a programmer's perspective, it is important to understand
<em>how</em> asynchronous concurrent tasks are created, how such tasks
<em>pause while waiting</em> for non-blocking I/O, and how the callbacks that
<em>handle the eventual results</em> are defined. In other words, you need to
understand coroutines, futures and tasks.</p>

<p>The <code>asyncio</code> module is helpfully simple about these
abstractions:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>asyncio.coroutine</code> - a
    <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/">decorator</a> that
    indicates a function is a coroutine. A coroutine is simply
    a type of
    <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/">generator</a> that
    uses the <code>yield from</code>, <code>return</code> or
    <code>raise</code> syntax to generate results.</li>
    <li>
<code>asyncio.Future</code> - a class used to represent a result that
    may not be available yet. It is an abstraction of something that has yet
    to be realised. Callback functions that process the eventual result are
    added to instances of this class (like a sort of to-do list of functions
    to be executed when the result is known). If you're familiar with
    <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">Twisted</a> they're called
    <em>deferreds</em> and elsewhere they're sometimes called
    <em>promises</em>.</li>
    <li>
<code>asyncio.Task</code> - a subclass of <code>asyncio.Future</code>
    that wraps a coroutine. The resulting object is realised when the
    coroutine completes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's examine each one of these abstractions in more detail:</p>

<p>A coroutine is a sort of generator function. A task defined
by a coroutine may be suspended; thus allowing the event loop to get on with
other things (as described above). The
<a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0380/"><code>yield from</code></a>
syntax is used to suspend a coroutine. A coroutine can <code>yield from</code>
other coroutines <em>or</em> instances of the <code>asyncio.Future</code>
class. When the <em>other</em>
coroutine has a result or the pending <code>Future</code> object is realised,
execution of the coroutine continues from the <code>yield from</code>
statement that originally suspended the coroutine (this is sometimes referred
to as re-entry). The result of a <code>yield from</code> statement will be
either the return value of the <em>other</em> coroutine or the result of the
<code>Future</code> instance. If the referenced coroutine
or <code>Future</code> instance raise an exception this will be propagated.
Ultimately, at the end of the <code>yield from</code> chain, will be a
coroutine that actually returns a result or raises an exception (rather than
yielding from some other coroutine).</p>

<p>A helpful (yet not entirely accurate) metaphor is the process of calling a
customer support line. Perhaps you want to know why your order for goods
is late. The person at the end of the phone explains they can't continue with
your query because they need to check something with their accounts
department. They promise to call you back. This pause is similar to the
<code>yield from</code> statement: they're suspending the work while they
wait for something else, thus allowing you to get on with other stuff. At some
point, their accounts department will provide a result and the customer
support agent will re-enter the process of handling your query and when
they're done, will fulfil their promise and give you a call (hopefully with
good news about your order).</p>

<p>The important concept to remember is that <code>yield from</code> suspends
coroutines pending a result so the event loop is able to get on with other
things. When the result becomes known, the coroutine resumes.</p>

<p>The following example (like many of the examples in this post, it's an
annotated modification of code in the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio-task.html#example-chain-coroutines">Python documentation</a>
on <code>asyncio</code>) illustrates these concepts by chaining coroutines
that ultimately add two numbers together:</p>

<p></p>
<pre><code class="python">"""
Two coroutines chained together.

The compute() coroutine is chained to the print_sum() coroutine. The
print_sum() coroutine waits until compute() is completed before it returns a
result.
"""
import asyncio


# Notice the decorator!
@asyncio.coroutine
def compute(x, y):
    print("Compute %s + %s ..." % (x, y))
    # Pause the coroutine for 1 second by yielding from asyncio's built in
    # sleep coroutine. This simulates the time taken by a non-blocking I/O
    # call. During this time the event loop can get on with other things.
    yield from asyncio.sleep(1.0)
    # Actually return a result!
    return x + y


@asyncio.coroutine
def print_sum(x, y):
    # Pause the coroutine until the compute() coroutine has a result.
    result = yield from compute(x, y)
    # The following print() function won't be called until there's a result.
    print("%s + %s = %s" % (x, y, result))


# Reference the event loop.
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
# Start the event loop and continue until print_sum() is complete.
loop.run_until_complete(print_sum(1, 2))
# Shut down the event loop.
loop.close()
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the coroutines only execute when the loop's
<code>run_until_complete</code> method is called.
<a href="http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/4ab2d8fac52b/Lib/asyncio/base_events.py#l190">Under the hood</a>,
the coroutine is wrapped in a <code>Task</code> instance and a callback is
added to this task that
<a href="http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/4ab2d8fac52b/Lib/asyncio/base_events.py#l72">raises the appropriate exception</a> needed to stop the loop (since
the task is realised because the coroutine completed). The task instance is
conceptually the same as the promise the customer support agent gave to
call you back when they finished processing your query (in the helpful
yet inaccurate metaphor described above). The return value of
<code>run_until_complete</code> is the task's result or, in the event of a
problem, its exception will be raised. In this example, the result is
<code>None</code> (since <code>print_sum</code> doesn't actually return
anything to become the result of the task).</p>

<p>The following sequence diagram illustrates the flow of activity:</p>

<p><img src="http://ntoll.org/static/images/tulip_coro.png" alt="Sequence diagram of a coroutine"></p>

<p>So far we've discovered that coroutines suspend and resume tasks in such
a way that the event loop can get on with other things. Yet this only
addresses how concurrent tasks co-exist through time given a single event
loop.  It doesn't tell us how to deal with the end result of such concurrent
tasks when they complete and the result of their computation becomes
known.</p>

<p>As has been already mentioned, the results of such pending concurrent
tasks are represented by instances of the <code>async.Future</code> class.
Callback functions are added to such instances via the
<code>add_done_callback</code> method. Callback functions have a single
argument: the <code>Future</code> instance to which they have been added.
They are executed when their <code>Future</code>'s result eventually becomes
known (we say the <code>Future</code> is resolved). Resolution involves
setting the result using the <code>set_result</code> method or, in the case
of a problem, setting the appropriate exception via
<code>set_exception</code>. The callback can access the
<code>Future</code>'s result (be it something valid or an exception) via the
<code>result</code> method: either the result will be returned or the
exception will be raised.</p>

<p>Another example (again, an annotated modification of code from the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio-task.html#example-future-with-run-forever">Python documentation</a>)
illustrates how this works:</p>

<p></p>
<pre><code class="python">"""
A future and coroutine interact. The future is resolved with the result of
the coroutine causing the specified callback to be executed.
"""
import asyncio


@asyncio.coroutine
def slow_operation(future):
    """
    This coroutine takes a future and resolves it when its own result is
    known
    """
    # Imagine a pause from some non-blocking network based I/O here.
    yield from asyncio.sleep(1)
    # Resolve the future with an arbitrary result (for the purposes of
    # illustration).
    future.set_result('A result set by the slow_operation coroutine!')


def got_result(future):
    """
    This function is a callback. Its only argument is the resolved future
    whose result it prints. It then causes the event loop to stop.
    """
    print(future.result())
    loop.stop()


# Get the instance of the event loop (also referenced in got_result).
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
# Instantiate the future we're going to use to represent the as-yet unknown
# result.
future = asyncio.Future()
# Wrap the coroutine in a task to schedule it for execution when the
# event loop starts.
asyncio.Task(slow_operation(future))
# Add the callback to the future. The callback will only be executed when the
# future is resolved by the coroutine. The future object is passed into the
# got_result callback.
future.add_done_callback(got_result)

# Run the event loop until loop.stop() is called (in got_result).
try:
    loop.run_forever()
finally:
    loop.close()
</code></pre>

<p>This example of futures and coroutines interacting probably feels awkward
(at least, it does to me). As a result, and because such interactions are so
fundamental to working with <code>asyncio</code>, one should use the
<code>asyncio.Task</code> class (a subclass of <code>asyncio.Future</code>)
to avoid such boilerplate code. The example above can be simplified and made
more readable as follows:</p>

<p></p>
<pre><code class="python">"""

    yield from asyncio.sleep(1)

    return 'A return value from the slow_operation coroutine!'


def got_result(future):
    """
    This function is a callback. Its only argument is a resolved future
    whose result it prints. It then causes the event loop to stop.

    In this example, the resolved future is, in fact, a Task instance.

    print(future.result())
    loop.stop()


# Get the instance of the event loop (also referenced in got_result).
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
# Wrap the coroutine in a task to schedule it for execution when the event

task = asyncio.Task(slow_operation())
# Add the callback to the task. The callback will only be executed when the

# Run the event loop until loop.stop() is called (in got_result).
try:
    loop.run_forever()
finally:
    loop.close()
</code></pre>

<p>To my eyes, this is a lot more comprehensible, easier to read and far
simpler to write. The <code>Task</code> class also makes it trivial to execute
tasks in parallel, as the following example (again,
<a href="http://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio-task.html?highlight=asyncio.sleep#example-parallel-execution-of-tasks">taken from the Python documentation</a>)
shows:</p>

<p></p>
<pre><code class="python">"""

import asyncio


@asyncio.coroutine
def factorial(name, number):
    """
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial

    f = 1
    for i in range(2, number+1):
        print("Task %s: Compute factorial(%s)..." % (name, i))
        yield from asyncio.sleep(1)
        f *= i
    print("Task %s: factorial(%s) = %s" % (name, number, f))


# Instantiating tasks doesn't cause the coroutine to be run. It merely
# schedules the tasks.
tasks = [
    asyncio.Task(factorial("A", 2)),
    asyncio.Task(factorial("B", 3)),
    asyncio.Task(factorial("C", 4)),
]


# Get the event loop and cause it to run until all the tasks are done.
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(asyncio.wait(tasks))
loop.close()
</code></pre>

<p>So far, all our examples have used the <code>asyncio.sleep</code> function
to simulate arbitrary amounts of time to represent the wait one might expect
for non-blocking network I/O. This is convenient for examples, but now that we
understand coroutines, futures and tasks we'd better examine how networking
fits into the picture.</p>

<p>There are two approaches one can take to network based operations: the
high level
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio-stream.html">Streams</a>
API or the lower level
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio-protocol.html">Transports
and Protocols</a> API. The following example (based on
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio-stream.html#example">this original implementation</a>)
shows how a coroutine works with non-blocking network I/O in order to
retrieve HTTP headers using the stream based API:

task = asyncio.async(print_http_headers(url))
loop.run_until_complete(task)
loop.close()
</code></pre>

<p>Note how, instead of yielding from <code>asyncio.sleep</code>, the
coroutine yields from the built in <code>open_connection</code> and
<code>readline</code> coroutines that handle the asynchronous networking I/O.
Importantly, the call to <code>write</code> does not block, but buffers the
data and sends it out asynchronously.</p>

<p>The lower level API should feel familiar to anyone who has written code
using the <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted framework</a>. What
follows is a trivial server (based on
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio-protocol.html#echo-server">this example</a>)
that uses transports and protocols.</p>

<p>Transports are classes provided by <code>asyncio</code> to abstract
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol">UDP</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS/SSL</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_%28Unix%29">subprocess pipes</a>.
Instances of such classes are responsible for the actual
I/O and buffering. However, you don't usually instantiate such classes
yourself; rather, you call the event loop instance to set things up (and
it'll call you back when it succeeds).</p>

<p>Once the connection is established, a
transport is always paired with an instance of the <code>Protocol</code>
class. You subclass <code>Protocol</code> to implement your own network
protocols; it parses incoming data and writes outgoing data by calling the
associated transport's methods for such purposes. Put simply, the
transport handles the sending and receiving of things down the wire, while
the protocol works out what the actual message means.</p>

<p>To implement a protocol override appropriate methods from the
<code>Protocol</code> parent class. Each time a connection is made (be it
incoming or outgoing) a new instance of the protocol is instantiated and
the various overridden methods are called depending on what network events
have been detected. For example, every protocol class will have its
<code>connection_made</code> and <code>connection_lost</code> methods
called when the connection begins and ends. Between these two calls one might
expect to handle <code>data_received</code> events and use the paired
<code>Transport</code> instance to send data. The following simple echo
server demonstrates the interaction between protocol and transport without
the distraction of coroutines and futures.</p>

A simple (yet poetic) echo server. ;-)

- ECHO -

Use your voice - say what you mean
Do not stand in the shadow
Do not become an echo of someone else's opinion
We must accept ourselves and each other
Even the perfect diamond
may have cracks and faults

echo_coroutine = loop.create_server(EchoProtocol, '127.0.0.1', 8888)
# Run the coroutine to actually establish the server.

try:
    # Run the event loop forever, waiting for new connections.
    loop.run_forever()

    # Unless we get Ctrl-C keyboard interrupt.
    print('exit')
finally:
    # Stop serving (existing connections remain open).
    server.close()
    # Shut down the loop.
    loop.close()
</code></pre>

<p>An example interaction with this server using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat">netcat</a>
is shown below:</p>

<p></p>
<pre><code>$ python echo.py &amp;
[1] 7486
$ nc localhost 8888
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
$ fg
python echo.py
^Cexit
</code></pre>

<p>Yet, this only scratches the surface of <code>asyncio</code> and I'm
cherry-picking the parts that most interest me. If you want to find out more
the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio.html">Python documentation</a>
for the module is a great place to start, as is
<a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3156/">PEP 3156</a> used to
specify the module.</p>

<p>In conclusion <code>asyncio</code> feels like Twisted on a diet with the
added fun and elegance of coroutines. I've generally had good experiences
using Twisted but always felt uncomfortable with its odd naming conventions
(for example, calling the
<a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedConch">secure shell implementation</a>
"conch" is the world's worst programming pun) and I suffer from an uneasy
feeling that it exists in a slightly different parallel Pythonic universe.
Personally, I feel <code>asyncio</code> is a step in the right direction
because such a lot of the "good stuff" from Twisted has made it into the
core language in a relatively small and obvious module. I'm also looking
forward to using it in my own projects (specifically,
<a href="http://drogul.us">the drogulus</a>).

</p>
<p>As I become more adept at using this module I may write up more.</p>
