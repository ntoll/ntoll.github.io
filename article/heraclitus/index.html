    <p>Two weeks after turning 18, I arrived in London to study for a music degree at
the <a href="https://rcm.ac.uk/">Royal College of Music</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../remembering-john/">It was an awakening</a>.</p>
<p>In those first months in London, as I began to fathom my situation, I realised
two things: I wouldn't become a professional musician and making sense of the
universe is a deeply challenging, subtle yet rewarding experience.
Imperceptibly, an awareness kindled within me: music, like all art, is a potent
and fluid process of encountering, understanding and expressing. It's how we
discern our dynamic and diverse universe yet, at the same time, change and
enlarge it through our creative contributions and collaborations. It is, I
believe, the most important and rewarding activity we can do, both singularly
as individuals and collectively shared with others.</p>
<p>Upon graduating, I needed a broader context in which to make
sense of things, so I embarked on a philosophy degree. It was an exciting
time...  I had <a href="../25-anniversary-plans/">just met Mary</a> and I was
acquiring a sense of the historic philosophical terrain while working out where
I found myself on the philosophical map.</p>
<p>A turning point was my first encounter with ancient Greek philosopher
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus">Heraclitus</a>, who has remained a
constant philosophical companion throughout my life. This blog post briefly
explores why Heraclitus resonates so much with me.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/heraclitus.jpg" alt="Heraclitus"><figcaption>A pensive Heraclitus, as depicted by Raphael in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_of_Athens">The School of Athens</a>.
(The figure is actually a portrait of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>, who
shared a misanthropic reputation with Heraclitus. To the right, in blue, is
Socrates.)
</figcaption></figure><p>Not much is known about Heraclitus, but what is probably true about him can be
said in a paragraph of four sentences.</p>
<p>Heraclitus, son of Bloson (or Heracon), was born and lived in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephesus">Ephesus</a> - a Greek city on the
west coast of modern day Turkey. He was a member of an aristocratic family and
gave up his hereditary right of "kingship" to his brother. His
<em>acme</em> (ancient Greek for "prime" - usually regarded as around the age of 40)
was considered by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollodorus_of_Athens">Apollodorus</a> to have
been the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiad">69th Olympiad</a> (504–501 BC),
and he probably died approximately thirty years later. He wrote a single
philosophical work, well known in antiquity but now lost, that may have been
titled "On Nature", a copy of which he placed as a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Votive_offering">votive deposit</a> in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Artemis">temple of Artemis</a> at
Ephesus.</p>
<p>That's it!</p>
<p>However, many spurious claims have been made about Heraclitus; the main source
being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_Laertius">Diogenes Laertius</a>'s
book
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/57342/57342-h/57342-h.htm">Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers</a>,
written in the 3rd century CE, around 700 years after Heraclitus flourished.
Diogenes is a problematic figure because he's a mixture of unreliable and
highly speculative gossip columnist, uncritical historical biographer and
scatter-gun reporter of "facts" (often lacking context, evidence or relevance).</p>
<p>His account of Heraclitus is a corker of a hatchet job, worthy of any British
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_journalism#Red_tops">red top</a> tabloid.</p>
<p>According to Diogenes, Heraclitus was an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism">autodidact</a>
who claimed to know
everything, regarded everyone else as a moron (with a few notable exceptions),
and preferred to play games with children than engage with his fellow citizens.
Because of his unpopularity and misanthropic nature he was forced to leave
Ephesus and live on a vegetarian diet, alone in the mountains. Eventually he
fell victim to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema">dropsy</a> and returned to
Ephesus where he sought treatment from the town's doctors by posing them
riddles. Unable to make sense of the riddles, the doctors failed to cure him.
Heraclitus took matters into his own hands and decided to cover himself in
bovine faeces in the hope the warmth of the fresh dung would dry out his
dropsy. This failed and he died at the age of seventy, after which his
"bullshit" encrusted body was devoured by a pack of dogs.</p>
<p>Yet Diogenes also reports that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates">Socrates</a>, no less, was a puckish fan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They say that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euripides">Euripides</a>, giving
him [Socrates] a work of Heraclitus to read, asked him what he thought of it,
and he replied: "The part I understand is excellent, and so too is, I dare
say, the part I do not understand; but it needs a Delian diver to get to the
bottom of it".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(A Delian diver fishes for pearls.)</p>
<p>This is a good illustration of Heraclitus's reputation in antiquity as obscure,
cryptic and difficult to fathom.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotle</a> complained about
Heraclitus's ambiguous punctuation and style in his
<a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=aristot.+rh.+1407b">Rhetoric</a>
(a treatise in the technique of argument), and Aristotle's student
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophrastus">Theophrastus</a> reported 
Heraclitus's book was disjointed and unfinished, attributing this to
Heraclitus's melancholic nature (resulting in Heraclitus's epithet "the weeping
philosopher").</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/weeping_philosopher.jpg" alt="Heraclitus as the weeping philosopher"><figcaption>Heraclitus, the weeping philosopher, as painted by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Moreelse">Johannes Moreelse</a>
in around 1630.</figcaption></figure><p>But Aristotle missed a subtle aspect of Heraclitus's technique of argument (in
his own work on the technique of argument!). Heraclitus's enigmatic style is
not a result of grammatical failings nor foggy thinking. He knew what he
wanted to say, and <em>how he wanted to say it</em>. His prose is often a subtle
embodiment of his philosophy. In fact, Heraclitus hints at this when he says,</p>
<blockquote>
<q>The Lord whose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia">oracle is at Delphi</a>
neither declares nor conceals, but shows by sign.</q>
(<cite>B93</cite>)
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, Heraclitus's writing neither declares nor conceals, but shows by
sign. His enigmatic writing style forces his readers to actively engage in the
analysis, comprehension and
literary appreciation of his words, as a vehicle to demonstrate his wider
philosophical point. To me this is more akin to poetry, perhaps because
Heraclitus was one of the first Greek prose writers - until that time, most
Greek writing had been poetry - and the basic conventions of prose writing had
not yet been established.</p>
<p>This first direct quote from Heraclitus about the Delphic oracle provides an
opportunity to explain the nature and organisation of the fragments that have
survived.</p>
<p>All that remains of Heraclitus's work are a small group of around 130
quotations, paraphrases and aphorisms found in the works of later authors
(such as Aristotle's quote from Heraclitus in his work on rhetoric). We have no
idea how most of these fragments relate to each other, nor where they appear in
the original book.</p>
<p>This is a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it is impossible to tell how Heraclitus organised his book's
philosophical narrative, how it was thematically arranged or discern the
structure of its exposition or the subsequent development of ideas. While I
believe there is strong evidence Heraclitus had a cogent and coherent structure
to the book, <em>what that was has been lost</em>. Therefore, arranging the fragments
is a deeply troublesome undertaking. To organise and interpret them according
to the themes found therein may help to capture the coherence of thought
behind the work, but risks speculation, educated guesswork and interpretation
reflecting the background, interests and prejudices of the curator. The
alternative, and most common practice, is to recognise the shortcomings of such
an approach and present them in an alternative fashion. This was how
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Alexander_Diels">Hermann Diels</a> 
compiled all the extant works of ancient Greek philosophers in a book called
Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker (The Fragments of the Pre-Socratics). In this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diels%E2%80%93Kranz_numbering">Diels–Kranz [DK] numbering</a>
system the fragments are mostly arranged according to the alphabetical order of
the names of the sources from which the fragments were taken. For instance
fragments found in the works of Aristotle come before those quoted in Diogenes.
This has become the standard, and the identifier B93 is the DK number for the
fragment quoted above.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/fragment.jpg" alt="A papyrus fragment quoting Heraclitus"><figcaption>Fragment B103a written on an ancient papyrus (Papyrus Oxyrhynchus
3710, col. ii 43-47).</figcaption></figure><p>On the other hand, the fractured provenance of the fragments is an opportunity
to honour Heraclitus's desire that we actively engage with his words and ideas.
Put simply, we need to pay close attention and work out for ourselves our own
interpretation and arrangement of the themes and ideas. For me, it matters not
that <em>our</em> view of the remaining fragments will be different to what Heraclitus
originally intended, yet it is of the utmost importance that we engage with and
are stimulated by the thoughts found therein.</p>
<p>Heraclitus says as much:</p>
<blockquote>
<q>Upon those who step into the same stream ever different waters flow.</q>
(<cite>B12</cite>)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<q>The person who loves wisdom must be a good inquirer into a great many
things.</q>
(<cite>B35</cite>)
</blockquote>

<p>In reading Heraclitus, I like to think we're undertaking a sort of
philosophical
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique">cut-up technique</a> (découpé).
Or perhaps we are using a more contemporary Internet-age share/remix/reuse
process, as championed by the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>.
My point is that [re]assembling Heraclitus's work is a fundamental aspect of
encountering and comprehending it. It's a very unconventional yet valuable
philosophical situation, and that's something to welcome!</p>
<p>Fragment B12, quoted above, is usually paraphrased into English as "one cannot
step into the same river twice", and is one of Heraclitus's best known
aphorisms. It is also a good example of the various linguistic quirks of
Heraclitus that make translation of the fragments a challenge.</p>
<p>There are broadly three aspects of translation that inform our understanding 
of the fragments.</p>
<p>It is important to be aware of the philological aspects of Heraclitus's
writing: his place in the history and development of ancient Greek, that he
wrote in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_Greek">Ionian dialect</a>
and that his prose style was perhaps deliberately aphoristic and even oracular
in tone at a point in time when such a prose style of writing was not yet
established nor refined to have widely understood conventions and
characteristics.</p>
<p>The semantic context of Heraclitus's writing is often fascinating and (as
Aristotle pointed out) sometimes frustrating. Heraclitus is deliberately
ambiguous yet careful in his choice of words, and a full understanding of a
fragment often depends upon recognising the sophisticated multi-layered
significance in the terminology Heraclitus employs (often as a way to embody
the concept[s] he is exploring or describing). Part of the fun in reading
Heraclitus is to uncover the colourful, intriguing and often revealing
interplay of such subtle linguistic layers.</p>
<p>Heraclitus's style of writing often contains puns, wordplay, neologisms,
assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and other compositional techniques
more commonly associated with poetry rather than prose. As has been mentioned,
Heraclitus was an early writer of ancient Greek prose so existing and well
established poetic techniques that would become absent in later forms of prose
still find their way into Heraclitus's writing. I find this aspect of
Heraclitus's style very engaging and appealing.</p>
<p>Returning to fragment B12, "one cannot step into the same river twice", while
mostly accurate in the broad sense of what the fragment is literally saying,
misses the more subtle aspects of the language employed. For instance, the
original ancient Greek is pronounced in such a way that the sentence
onomatopoeically babbles like a river, while the grammar makes it ambiguous if
the river or the person stepping into it have changed. This grammatical twist
demonstrates a subtle philosophical point: the fragment can be read in
different ways (one cannot step into the same sentence twice!), and thus the
meaning is changed as one reads the sentence one way or the other. It
(literally) illustrates the changing nature of re-encountering changed things
— precisely the concept the fragment is exploring. For me, this is but
one example of Heraclitus's engaging, playful and sophisticated literary style.</p>
<p>These points are beautifully explored in this short audio extract from an
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b017x3p4">episode on Heraclitus</a> from the
magnificent BBC radio series,
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl">In Our Time</a>.
I hope you especially pay attention to the babbling pronunciation of the
fragment.</p>
<p><audio src="../../static/files/heraclitus.mp3" controls style="width: 100%;"></audio></p>
<p>There are many English translations of Heraclitus. They range from the literal
side-by-side with the ancient Greek
(<a href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL526/2016/volume.xml">Loeb</a>), or the
poetic
(<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Greeks-New-Directions-Paperbook-799/dp/0811212882">Guy Davenport</a>)
to the academic (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Thought-Heraclitus-Arrangement-Philosophical/dp/052128645X">Charles H.Khan</a>)
and the literary (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Heraclitus-Translation-Analysis-Dennis-Sweet/dp/0761833676">Dennis Sweet</a>).
Each reveals a different aspect of Heraclitus's writing and reading numerous
translations (as I have done) is itself a stimulating exploration of how others
have [re]assembled, [re]interpreted and [re]presented Heraclitus's words and
philosophy. It feels to me like listening to different musicians performing 
contrasting interpretations of a composer's work.</p>
<p>Remember the sentence that so annoyed Aristotle? Here's the original Greek and
how each of the afore mentioned translations render it - along with any
translator's notes relating to the sentence. It's the famous first
line of the first fragment which, we can be reasonably confident, opened
Heraclitus's book. It introduces the important concept of <em>logos</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<q>τοῦ δὲ λόγου τοῦδ ἐόντος ἀεὶ ἀξύνετοι γίνονται ἄνθρωποι καὶ πρόσθεν ἢ ἀκοῦσαι καὶ ἀκούσαντες τὸ πρῶτον·</q>
(<cite>Original</cite>)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<q>And of this account (<em>logos</em>) that is—always—humans are
uncomprehending, both before they hear it and once they have first heard it.
</q>
(<cite>Loeb</cite>)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<q>The Logos is eternal<br>
but men have not heard it<br>
and men have heard it and not understood.</q>
(<cite>Davenport</cite>)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<q>Although this account holds forever, men ever fail to comprehend, both
before hearing it and once they have heard.</q>
(<cite>Khan</cite>)
<p><small><strong>account:</strong> <em>logos</em>, saying, speech, discourse,
statement, report; account, explanation, reason, principle; esteem, reputation;
collection, enumeration, ratio, proportion; <em>logos</em> is translated
'account' here (twice) and also in III, XXVII, LX and LXII; it is rendered
'report' in XXXV, XXXVI and CI; 'amount' in XXXIX.</small></p>
<p><small><strong>holds forever:</strong> text is ambiguous between 'this
account is forever, is eternal' and 'this account is true (but men ever fail
to comprehend)'.</small></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<q>Of this eternally existing<sup>[<a href="#ref1">1</a>]</sup><em>logos</em> people lack

(<cite>Sweet</cite>)
<p id="ref1">1 <small>I follow Diels and Zeller (after Clement, Hippolytus, and Amelius)
in putting ἀεὶ with ἐόντος, <em>contra</em> Reinhardt, Snell, Gigon, and Kirk,
who connect it with ἀξύνετοι. This seems to be a more natural grammatical
construction and is more consistent with Heraclitus's doctrine of the eternity
of the <em>logos</em>. Cf fr. 30.</small></p>
<p id="ref2">2 <small>Since τὸ πρῶτον contains an article and is in the accusative
case, it is treated here as the object of ἀκοῦσαι and ἀκούσαντες. This
interpretation implies the fundamental nature of the <em>logos</em> rather
than simply indicating the first hearing of the idea (<em>contra</em> Kirk
[1962], p.33).</small></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For what it's worth, in this blog post I use Dennis Sweet's translations into
English because he attempts to retain the flavour of the original Greek, while
rendering the fragments into coherent English that carefully acknowledge the
inherent playful poetic style and multiple layers of meaning. I'm also very
fond of Davenport's poetic rendering of the fragments, although these very much
reflect <em>his</em> personal aesthetic and interpretation, and may not appeal to
scholars or "purists" (like the Jacques Loussier Trio
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnvEG9cDiwk">performing Bach</a> to Jazz
afficionados or fans of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_informed_performance">historically informed performance</a>).</p>
<p>Given such context and back story, I can finally begin to explain <em>my personal</em>
impressions of Heraclitus's philosophical themes. These are offered as a record
of my own encounter with Heraclitus's work, and certainly shouldn't be treated
as learned or scholarly. What do I know? I'm just a humble tuba player.</p>
<p>Heraclitus's philosophical project is to explore an apparent paradox: the
<em>unity of the universe</em> in the face of apparent <em>diversity and change</em>, and
core to this account is the eternal λόγος (logos).</p>
<p>Logos had many related meanings over time, and Heraclitus plays on this
richness of meaning. In the context of ancient Greek it originally meant
"selecting" or "picking out". The meaning shifted to "reckon", "measure" and
"proportion". Further refinement of its usage led to it meaning "thought", 
"reason", as well as "formula", "law" and "plan". It also had connotations
around speaking, via a common etymological root with the ancient Greek verb
λέγω (lego, "to speak"). So logos can also mean a spoken word, a statement,
account, discourse or report. It is also the source for our modern English
word, "logic".</p>
<p>Heraclitus uses it to mean three broad concepts: the order (unity) underlying a
universe of diversity and change, the capacity of a person to discern and make
sense of such a situation (although very few people exercise this talent),
and our ability to communicate our thoughts about such things with others. Each
is a different facet of the eternal logos.</p>
<p>Put in a more personal (and musical) manner, the eternal logos consists of
three aspects: the singularly unified universe full of diversity and change
<em>that we encounter</em>, our cultivated and refined mental faculties <em>through which
we understand</em> the universe, and our <em>skill at expressing</em> our shared feelings
about, experiences and understanding of the universe with one another.</p>
<p>In Heraclitus's own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<q>Listening not to me but rather to the <em>logos</em> it is wise to
agree<sup>[<a href="#ref46">46</a>]</sup> that all things are one.</q>
(<cite>B50</cite>)
<p id="ref46">46 <small>A play upon the words <em>logos</em> and <em>homologein</em> =
to agree.</small></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<q>Seizures<sup>[<a href="#ref11">11</a>]</sup> —wholes and non-wholes, being combined and
differentiated, in accord and dissonant: unity is from everything and from
everything is unity.</q>
(<cite>B10</cite>)
<p id="ref11">11 <small>sullapsies (συλλάψιες)—following Marcovich, Kirk, etc.,
<em>contra</em> Diels' συνάψιες. I have translated this word in its archaic
sense, which gives the notion of physical seizure or grasping. Snell, Kirk,
Marcovich, and Bollack-Wismann employ later senses ('Zusammensetzungen',
'things taken together', 'connections', and 'assemblages', respectively) in
their translations. All of these terms suggest a putting together and
unification of diverse things. Cf. the discussion of
<em>harmonia</em>.</small></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<q>Thinking is common to all.</q>
(<cite>B113</cite>)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<q>For since everything comes to be according to this <em>logos</em>, they are
like ignorant people when experiencing such words<sup>[<a href="#ref3">3</a>]</sup> and actions as
I expound—when I describe each according to its nature<sup>[<a href="#ref4">4</a>]</sup>,

<p>The notions of commonality and universality are attributes that facilitate the
eternal logos. Sharing aspects both in common and universally, explains how
different things are able to correspond and coordinate with each other. Such
ordering relates to all things, and can be discerned, understood and
communicated by those rare persons who explore and engage with the eternal
logos.</p>
<p>Clearly Heraclitus was prickly when trying to acknowledge that not everyone
recognises, values or is capable of such philosophical explorations. He
explains that "the many are worthless and good people are few" (in fragment
B104), and is unflattering about his fellow citizens:</p>
<blockquote>
<q>The Ephesians deserve, from the young men to the old, to be hanged, and to
leave the city to the beardless youths, since they cast out Hermodorus, their
best man, saying, 'let no one be the best among us: if he is, let him be so
elsewhere and among others'.</q>
(<cite>B121</cite>)
</blockquote>

<p>But could this be because "nature tends to hide itself" (fragment B123) or
because most people, "know neither how to listen nor how to speak"
(fragment B19)?</p>
<p>Sadly, things don't look good for most people because,</p>

<p>Clearly if the learning of intellectual Titans like Hesiod and Pythagoras
et al, doesn't result in understanding, what chance do mere mortals have?
Perhaps it's just a case of luck since "one's character is one's divine
fortune" (fragment 119)? Clearly a good metaphor is needed to illuminate the
nature of the logos to the ignorant hoi polloi. This is precisely what
Heraclitus does when he poetically plays with "fire".</p>
<p>Early Greek philosophers were traditionally interested in discerning the
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle">arche</a>" — the first
principle or element from which everything else can be derived. For instance,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus">Thales</a> claimed
water was the arche, while
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander">Anaximander</a> said it was "the
infinite", and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximenes_of_Miletus">Anaximenes</a> considered it
air.</p>
<p>It is often claimed that Heraclitus believed fire was the arche. In one sense
it is true, because Heraclitus uses fire to symbolise the logos (his own
underlying principle from which everything else follows), but in another sense
it is false because I don't think Heraclitus thought everything was (literally)
derived from fire - although some appear to believe this the case. I suspect,
given the playful and poetic personality of Heraclitus, he's using a metaphor.</p>
<p>Fire is actually a very good metaphor for logos. Fire represents change because
it transforms the burning things. Yet fire is also unchanging alongside change,
it retains its unity through time (so the flame flickering at the top of a
candle at the start of the evening is the same flame as that at the end of the
evening). Fire is also dry - an important property that Heraclitus uses to
indicate an enlightened person (who has a dry soul). This is also perhaps why
Diogenes claimed Heraclitus died of dropsy (he had a wet soul that he tried to
dry out with bullshit). Significantly, fire is created through friction
(opposition and strife), such as when striking flints or rubbing sticks
together. As we shall see, opposition and strife are important aspects of
Heraclitus's account of the eternal logos.</p>
<blockquote>
<q>Fire, having come upon them, will distinguish<sup>[<a href="#ref66">66</a>]</sup> and seize all

<blockquote>
<q>It is delight or<sup>[<a href="#ref74">74</a>]</sup> death for souls to become moist.</q>
(<cite>B77</cite>)
<p id="ref74">74 <small>I follow Diels and Marcovich in reading ἢ (<em>contra</em> Kahn's
μἡ), since it lends itself more readily to the two senses of a 'moist soul'
which Heraclitus intends. On the one hand, a moist soul is said to be found in
the person who is drunk or ignorant (confused by appearances). On the other
hand, when the ignorant person dies, that person's moist soul disintegrates and
unites with water in an endless cycle of elemental change.</small></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Change, in a universe of unity (i.e. <em>all things are one</em>), is caused by
conflict and strife between opposites interacting via the common and
universal. Change emerges in both the external and internal worlds. The
external universe is in a state of constant flux through conflict, but a
person's understanding, perspective and way of paying attention can also
change. The logos is how we encounter, understand and express this state of
affairs.</p>
<blockquote>
<q>What is in opposition is in agreement, and the most beautiful harmony comes
out of things in conflict (and all happens<sup>[<a href="#ref10">10</a>]</sup> according to
strife).</q>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<q>The way up and down is one and the same.</q>
(<cite>B60</cite>)
</blockquote>

<p>This resonates with my musical side: discord resolves to consonance,
contrasting themes somehow fit together, differences within musical elements
(loud/soft, fast/slow, high/low etc.) engage attention. Yet the piece is a
musical integration of such contrasts, and the manner in which such contrasts
unfold and interact through time gives the piece its unity. Furthermore, one's
perception of a piece changes upon repeated performances as new details are
revealed, the strange becomes familiar or a new perspective is acquired because
of the ongoing enlargement of one's lived experience.</p>
<p>By recognizing the interdependence and fitting together of things in opposition
we glimpse a yet more fundamental and hidden unity. Heraclitus claims the unity
of opposites is essential <em>for the existence of the different things in
opposition</em>, for their mutual dependency unifies them.</p>
<blockquote>
<q>Disease makes health sweet and good; hunger satiety, weariness repose.</q>
(<cite>B111</cite>)
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, some things only exist because they arise from the strife of
mixing or fitting together of different opposing parts, that would otherwise
separate from each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<q>(Even the potion<sup>[<a href="#ref116">116</a>]</sup> separates unless stirred).</q>
(<cite>B125</cite>)
<p id="ref116">116 <small><em>kukeon</em> (κυκεὼν) — a drink mentioned in the
<em>Iliad</em> (XI 637 ff.), which was composed of wine, barley-meal, and
grated cheese.</small></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Kukeon apparently behaved much like a modern-day vinaigrette.)</p>
<p>Heraclitus uses the word ἁρμονίη (harmony) to mean a sort of concordant,
satisfying and purposeful fitting together. The most beautiful harmony comes
about when things are in conflict: as in music, a dissonance makes the harmony
beautiful, in contrast to the bland aural goop of continuous consonance. Only
by becoming conscious of the hidden harmony in the universe — change
through an unending process of the fitting together of conflict, opposition and
strife — can one comprehend the paradox that the apparently disjointed
and diverse appearance of things is actually a unified whole - the eternal
logos.</p>
<blockquote>
<q>The hidden harmony is superior<sup>[<a href="#ref53">53</a>]</sup> to the visible.</q>
(<cite>B54</cite>)
<p id="ref53">53 <small><em>kreitton</em> (κρείττων) = stronger, more desirable.</small></p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does one become conscious of such hidden logos-related things?</p>
<p>As we have seen, Heraclitus believed most people don't develop such awareness.
Instead they act as if isolated, asleep or ignorant.</p>
<blockquote>
<q>But although the <em>logos</em> is common, most people live as though they
possess a private purpose<sup>[<a href="#ref7">7</a>]</sup>.</q>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<q>Those listening without understanding are like the deaf. The saying bears

<p>Nor did he believe learning and study help with the acquisition of such a
rarefied and enlightened point of view.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Rather, he preferred direct experience (over academic learning) and deep
self reflection as complementary ways to perceive the eternal logos.</p>

<blockquote>
<q>The soul is a law that increases its own power.</q>
(<cite>B115</cite>)
</blockquote>

<p>When learning by listening to another (fragment 17), one often does not hear
(comprehend) what they are saying. Rather, a direct <em>encounter</em> with the
universe, through one's own eyes or because of one's own efforts, is preferable
(fragments 101a and 101). When paired with a sound mind and disciplined soul
(fragments 112 and 116) one <em>understands</em> the true nature of things. This is a
self-transformative virtuous circle (fragment 115) that becomes more effective
with more practise (like learning a musical instrument!). Direct experience and
self-reflection — an immediate, lived and first-hand appreciation of the
eternal logos — is how to encounter, understand, express and ultimately
transcend the paradox of the <em>unity of the universe</em> in the face of apparent
<em>diversity and change</em>.</p>
<p>Heraclitus is a challenging philosopher: his writing forces us to engage in the
self-reflection needed to make sense of our direct experience of the universe.
In fact, we should work things out for ourselves and not rely on the teachings
of others, perhaps explaining why he neither declares nor conceals, but shows
by sign. Heraclitus points the way but expects us to make sense of the universe
ourselves: a deeply challenging, subtle yet rewarding experience that appeals
to very few. The ambiguous poetry of his words, the fragmentary and fractured
organisation of his thoughts, and the playfully demonstrative crafting of his
aphorisms ensures Heraclitus is a perennially intriguing, stimulating and
relevant philosopher to those who are tuned in and receptive to his peculiar
yet profound and transfiguring exploration of the universe.</p>
<p>For upon those who read the same words, thoughts and aphorisms, ever different
reflections and responses will flow.</p>
<p>One can never step into the same Heraclitus twice. :-)</p>
