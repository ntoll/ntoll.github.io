	<p>The short answer: There isn't going to be an AIMLBot 3.0.</p>

	<p>However, for the last few months I have been working hard on a new project that I'm currently calling Botkit (this name will probably change).</p>

	<p>Botkit grew out of what was to be AIMLBot 3.0. </p>

	<p>Put simply, I've raised the level of abstraction: Botkit is a framework for creating conversational agents in lots of different ways &#8211; in much the same way that ASP.NET can be used to create lots of different types of web-application. </p>

	<p>To demonstrate this I'll be releasing a "reference" AIML bot (what was AIMLBot 3.0) as well as a few other types of conversational agent to show what Botkit it is capable of.</p>

	<p>Its still early days yet but I'm making lots of progress and working hard on my trusty laptop during my daily commute to London.</p>

	<p>What I can reveal is that:</p>

	<ul>

		<li>It is written for the .NET/Mono platform. </li>

		<li>The core library will be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_license">dual licensed</a> under the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">GNU Affero GPL</a> and a commercial license.</li>

		<li>A free-to-use but closed source single user Windows/XAML based smart-client will be released so people can play with the core library and build their own agents. (There will be similar application written for Mono.)</li>

		<li>There already is extensive developer documentation and reference material.</li>

		<li>A closed-source commercial multi-user server version will be available to allow customers to deploy conversational agents to websites, IRC, IM and mobile devices.</li>

	</ul>

	<p>I'll post more details soon.</p>
