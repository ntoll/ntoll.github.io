<p>Sometimes people need privacy: intimate declarations of love, doctors
discussing a patient, engineers developing a new top secret world changing
product and journalists planning an exposé of government
corruption are just a few scenarios where privacy is both a reasonable and
legitimate requirement.</p>

<p>This need extends to our digital lives. For example, sensitive credit card
information is privately shared to complete on-line purchases. Furthermore,
<em>you</em> may be that lover, doctor, engineer or political journalist in
need of private communication via the Internet. Maybe you simply don't like
the idea of others reading your personal digital communications.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">Public key
cryptography</a> is probably the most widespread solution to ensure
privacy on-line. This article briefly explains what it is and how it works
before concentrating on its uses.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">Cryptography</a> is
the study and application of techniques that secure
communication in the presence of third parties (some of whom may wish to
eavesdrop). It is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob#List_of_characters">
traditional</a> to identify the various parties involved in a cryptographic
communication as Alice (the sender), Bob (the recipient) and Eve (the
[sometimes nefarious] eavesdropper). In the specific case of communications
sent via <a href="../internet-concise-and-simple">the Internet</a>,
messages may be handled by a large number of intermediary devices en-route to
their destination. Any of these intermediaries may read the content of the
message; in fact, they may need to in order to correctly route it to the
intended recipient. To put it another way, the Internet is a public broadcast
mechanism and its constituent devices are all Eve.</p>

<img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/alice_and_bob.png" alt="Eve explains why she's interested in Alice and Bob's communication."><p>To overcome this problem, the meaningful content of messages (usually called
the plaintext) is encrypted (in to something called the ciphertext) before
being sent via the Internet. Such content appears as gobbledegook to
devices handling the message on its journey to the recipient. Once
received the recipient decrypts the ciphertext to retrieve the original
meaningful plaintext message.</p>

<p>The process of encryption and decryption is done by a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher">cipher</a> -
instructions that explain how to transform plaintext into ciphertext. An
additional secret
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography)">key</a>, known only
to the sender and recipients, is also used by the cipher to ensure only those
with the key can read such communication.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Within a computing context the plaintext, ciphertext and key are all
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital">digital</a> assets - things
that are ultimately represented by binary values. In
other words, such assets are merely very large numbers. Therefore, the cipher
is only a mathematical function. It encrypts by using the key (a number) to
turn the plaintext (a number) into the ciphertext (also a number). Decryption
is similar in that it uses the key to turn the ciphertext into the original
plaintext.</p>

<p>For cryptography to work both sender and receiver[s] must share information
about the cipher and key to be used for secure communication. This presents a
problem: how should Alice and Bob share such fundamental information? Any
communication between them at this stage is insecure because they are yet to
share and agree upon the cryptographic means for secure communication.
Furthermore, Eve may be listening in to intercept such details and could use
what she learns to listen in on the supposed secure communication. Alice and Bob
find themselves in a crypto-chicken-and-egg situation.</p>

<p>This is where public key cryptography provides an elegant solution. Rather
than use a single key, participants have two: a public key that they
share with the whole world and a private key that they keep for themselves.
Because of the mathematical relationship between the two keys it is only
possible to decrypt a ciphertext with the <em>other</em> key in the pair. If
Alice wants to send information to Bob she uses Bob's <em>public</em> key to
encrypt her message and sends the resulting ciphertext. Importantly, only Bob
can decrypt the message since only his <em>private</em> key can turn the
ciphertext into plaintext. Eve can observe the complete exchange without
gaining the information she needs to decrypt the message from Alice to Bob
because Bob's private key is never transmitted.</p>

<p>Public key cryptography (specifically the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm)">RSA</a> algorithm) is
thought secure because it depends upon integer factorization - the process of
decomposing a number into its constituent prime-number divisors. In other
words, every whole number is the result of multiplying a unique set
of prime numbers together. For example, to get the number 12
use 2×2×3. As the number gets larger finding the constituent
prime numbers becomes too hard to be solved in a realistic amount of time.
Public key cryptography uses two huge prime numbers that result in
<em><code>n</code></em>, an even longer number whose length is measured in
"bits" (the longer the better) and whose value is used by the cipher.
Currently, <em><code>n</code></em> of 2048 bits length is considered secure
given currently available computing power (i.e. given a huge amount of
computing power it would still take an inordinate amount of time to crack).</p>

<p>In terms of the modus operandi of public key cryptography, that's about all
you need to know without going in to technical details. There are many
excellent explanations of how public key cryptography works "under to hood" and
constraints of space stop me from going in to more detail. However, the video
embedded below provides an engaging and comprehensive explanation and is part
of the excellent series
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/course?list=ECB4D701646DAF0817">Gambling with
Secrets</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ArtOfTheProblem">Art of
the Problem</a>.</p>

<p>An interesting side effect of public key cryptography is that it can be
used to "sign" digital assets to prove provenance or identity. Given that any
digital asset is simply a large number it is possible to use a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">hash function</a> - a
means of mapping variable length numbers to relatively small, fixed
length numbers - to create a unique "signature" that can be cryptographically
verified. Consider the following
snippet of Python code (don't worry if you can't program, it's easy to
follow):</p>

<p></p>
<pre><code class="python">from hashlib import sha1
my_digital_asset = open('war-and-peace.txt').read()
hash = sha1(my_digital_asset)
print int(hash.hexdigest().encode('hex'), 16)
</code></pre>

<p>This simply loads the complete text of
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600.txt">War and Peace</a>
and uses a hashing
algorithm called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA1</a> to
generate the <code>hash</code> that is printed on the screen as an
integer (whole number). The resulting hash for War and Peace is the number:</p>

<p><code>435515005527869578462696388723361351836071321997289162047109517397984640443675003720894549210723</code></p>

<p>Alice encodes this number with her private key
and sends the resulting signature to Bob. Bob uses Alice's <em>public</em> key
to
decrypt the signature and retrieve the hash we generated above. Then <em>he</em>
attempts to create <em>his own hash</em> of the complete text of War and
Peace. If
his hash matches Alice's he knows that both he and Alice are referencing the
<em>same</em> digital asset. If the text for War and Peace had only one letter
changed (either by mistake or because someone was tampering with it) then the
hashes would have been different. As Bob knows only Alice has access to
her private key, and only Alice's <em>public key</em> can decrypt such
a signature then he can trust the provenance of the digital asset "signed"
by Alice since only she could have created such a signature with her
private key. In this way, Alice can also cryptographically sign her own
messages to Bob.</p>

<p>It is important to acknowledge the political aspect of public key
cryptography. Politicians, the Police and security services complain that
terrorists and criminals use strong cryptography to hide
their illegal activities. Laws such as the U.K.'s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_Investigatory_Powers_Act_2000">RIPA</a>
give the government and other public authorities (such as the Police or local
council) powers to force you to hand over your private keys. When challenged
about this curtailment of civil liberties (see article 12 of the UN's
<a href="https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human
Rights</a>) a common response is, "if you have nothing to hide, you have
nothing to fear". This is, of course, a dangerous attitude: the authorities get
to decide what "nothing to hide" means and this changes all the time. For
example, since the introduction of RIPA the list of authorities empowered by
the act has increased four times (in 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2010). How would you
feel if the recording industry became an authority and insisted you hand over
keys so they can check your audio collection?</p>

<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orwellian">Orwellian</a> prospect
if ever there was one.</p>

<p>Finally, development of such cryptographic technology is usually done in
public by experts. It is open and public because problems and bugs are spotted
quicker. Furthermore, designing and implementing cryptographic systems
requires significant domain expertise. This convention ensures there are
always freely available, well tested and well designed cryptographic libraries
for non-expert programmers to re-use in their projects.</p>

<p>The challenge for programmers and cryptographers is to make the use of
strong encryption the norm. It is ubiquitous for on-line financial transactions
but most other things (email, web browsing, chat and other such digital
interactions) are usually <em>not</em> secured. I suspect this will remain the
case until people realise that their on-line life is currently like living in a
house with no curtains.</p>
