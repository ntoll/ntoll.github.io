    <p><a href="https://pyweek.org/">PyWeek</a> is a simple idea: write a game,
using the Python programming language, from scratch, on a given theme, within a
week. Take part as either an individual or a member of a team entry. At the end
of the week play, feedback and score each others' entries. After which, an
individual and team are crowned respective champions for their category of
entry.</p>

<p>I have taken part in three different iterations of PyWeek. Each one has
been extraordinarily good fun.</p>

<p>My first PyWeek was as an individual entry. The theme was "two worlds", so
I imagined a paper based battle between the worlds of blue biros and red biros
(it felt like a good idea at the time...). I wanted to push the limits of my
<a href="https://codewith.mu/">Mu code editor</a> for beginner programmers and
<a href="https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">PyGameZero</a> (a
gaming framework for beginner programmers integrated into Mu, developed by my
buddy [and organiser of PyWeek] <a href="." http:></a>Dan Pope).
The end result was a side-scrolling chase game called
<a href="https://github.com/ntoll/paperchase">PaperChase</a>. This video shows
me testing the game with my (then) thirteen year old son... you'll quickly
get the idea:</p>

</div>

<p>My next entry was as part of a team. I'd been helping author and
journalist
<a href="https://andrewsmithauthor.com/">Andrew Smith</a> to
<a href="https://www.1843magazine.com/features/code-to-joy">take his
first steps into coding</a>. Making a game seemed like a fun vehicle for
further learning. The theme was "flow" and so we devised a simple
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger">Frogger</a> clone
where you avoided traffic flow whilst being chased by lumbering zombies.
I did the code and Andrew did the sound and music. The end result
(<a href="https://github.com/ntoll/traffic_flowmageddon">Trafficflowmageddon</a>)
is, I feel, quite cute... as zombie relate games go...</p>

<div class="video-container">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/08mvNmhOVG4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>And so we come to the most recent PyWeek.</p>

<p>Once again, Andrew and I teamed up. We chatted before hand about the sort
of game we might want to make. Since we both have a love of the written word we
decided to go with a text-based (rather than graphical) game -- the theory
being it would play to our "strengths" with the written word.</p>

<p>In the end, this was (by far and away) my favourite PyWeek so far. Here's
why...</p>

<p>Graphical games show, text based games describe. Graphical games have an
added cost of "asset" development (the graphical stuff shown on the screen)
whereas text based games only need typed characters. Graphical games tend to
focus on hand/eye skill to progress gameplay, whereas textual games necessarily
put narrative, meaning and intent at the centre of their process.</p>

<p>Obviously, these are broad generalisations. But what I want to get to is
the idea of a player engaging with a game imaginatively, emotionally and
intellectually via the medium of words. If done properly, the depth of
engagement is potentially greater. I'm not saying one can't be engaged in such
a way with graphical games, rather that textual games are perhaps a medium
which more easily lend themselves to this end. It's similar to the difference
between a book and a film.</p>

<p>I want to be clear, I'm not saying one is better than the other, these are
very different ways to tell a story or play a game, but I can't help but feel a
"reader" has to do more (and the reward is therefore greater) than a
"viewer".</p>

<p>I also think that text-based games are, in a sense, more egalitarian and
accessible. Again, to continue the book/film similarity, while no mean feat,
writing a book is within the realms of a single author armed with just a pen
and paper, whereas making a film requires a cast of collaborators and
specialists, equipment, facilities, locations and deep pockets. For similar
reasons, the generation and manipulation of textual game content is far simpler
and affordable than for graphical games.</p>

<p>So what sort of games are textual?</p>

<p>Easy! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure">Adventure games</a>!
If you're interested in finding out more about this style of text-based game
you should watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o15itQ_EhRo">GET LAMP</a>,
a fascinating documentary about the genre. Alternatively, if you want to try
playing an example of such a game, I've embedded one of my favourites below
(just click on it and type some commands). It's based on Douglas Adams'
"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" (the game itself was co-authored by
Adams).</p>

</div>

<p>Here's where it gets interesting.</p>

<p>Such games don't have to be single player, solo efforts. While this is a fun
way to play, things get far more interesting if you can play with others. This
is not a new idea and I remember playing such games (commonly called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUD</a> "Multi-User Dungeons") via
surreptitious use of my school's single 1200 baud modem when the teacher wasn't
looking. These were often Tolkien-esque fantasy themed virtual worlds where
players could wander about exploring, socialising and cooperating to achieve
some in-game outcome (usually a quest of some sort). Later, when I was at
university in the mid-1990s, I began using a type of multi-user textual world
called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOO">MOO</a> (Multi-user Object
Oriented). The wonderful thing about MOO based textual worlds is that they are
programmable by users (I first got to grips with object-orientation via
learning to program MOO). In a sense the MOO is both the game and a platform
for creating textual games collaboratively. It was this sense of a creative
textual virtual world that Andrew and I wanted to recreate.</p>

<p>Et voilà, "TextSmith" was born.</p>

<p>The theme for this most recent PyWeek was announced as "six". This
fitted our idea for an interactive textual platform. It could contain six
different literary worlds which players collaboratively create, inhabit and
explore together. The six literary worlds we "seeded" in our game were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jane Austen: Recreate Netherfield, go to a ball, affect regency period
    manners and etiquette.</li>
    <li>Poetic Passions: Everything is a poem, haiku or rhymes, speak in
    riddles or chat in rhyming couplets.</li>
    <li>Hardboiled Detectives: It was about eleven o'clock in the morning, with
    the sun not shining. The client asked, "Well, will you take the case or
    not, bud?"</li>
    <li>J.R.R.Fantasy: Orcs! Elves! Wizards! Bleak locations! Ancient mystery!
    Quests! (And impenetrable prose.)</li>
    <li>SciFi and Future Worlds: As the service droids efficiently cleaned up
    the remains of the ship's captain, I wondered how long it would take to
    make planet-fall on the alien world of Zaonce.</li>
    <li>Parry Hotter: Inspired by everyone's favourite boy wizard, but in such
    a way that Warner Brothers don't go after us for copyright infringement.
    :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>Programming the game was a lot of fun. I managed to build everything mostly
from scratch (except for the web based front-end which uses the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart">Quart</a> web microframework).
Sadly, most of it was unfinished, broken and clunkily implemented. The
important thing is that it has <em>potential</em>. Below is a screenshot of
an early version of the game:</p>

<p><img src="../../static/images/textsmith.png" alt="The TextSmith client."></p>

<p>Happily, despite the unfinished and rather shonky nature of the end result,
we placed 4th in the team category..! Our highest result..! The
<a href="https://pyweek.org/e/CodeToJoy/ratings/">feedback</a>
from fellow PyWeekers was encouraging too and, as a result, I've decided to
continue to develop TextSmith. In the immediate term this will involve plugging
in the almost-finished scripting language I created and knock off some of the
hard edges. More importantly, once this aspect of the "platform" settles down,
I'm looking forward to creating and exploring interactive literary worlds.</p>

<p>Finally, programming, creating and playing with TextSmith has been a very
rich seam of reflection in terms of both technical and playful contexts. I've
had lots of fun thinking about the architecture and implementation of such a
platform while also doing a philosophical deep-dive into what on earth is going
on when "players" connect to, create within and interact with such a
platform.</p>

<p>Who knows where this may lead..?</p>
