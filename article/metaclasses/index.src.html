<p><a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> is an easy-to-learn modern
programming language with a simple yet elegant implementation of object
orientation. This post explains one dark corner of Python's implementation of
object orientation: metaclasses (but does so as if explaining the <a
href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/learningenglish/2011/09/howzat.shtml">rules
of cricket</a>).</p>

<p>Objects represent things. Type, <code>type(my_object)</code> to find out
what type of thing your object is. The type of thing an object represents is
defined by its "type". Classes define types of things to be instantiated as
objects. To be absolutely clear, objects represent types of things defined by
classes.</p>

<p>Now, listen carefully!</p>

<p>In Python, classes <strong>are also</strong> objects. This raises
an important question: what type of thing is a class?</p>

<p>The answer is that a class is a type of thing that can instantiate objects.
This type of thing (a class's class) is a class's metaclass which, incidently,
in Python defaults to a special class called <code>type</code> ~ whose type
is, circularly, <code>type</code> (i.e. itself).</p>

<p>You can change the metaclass of a class by setting it's
<code>__metaclass__</code> attribute to a class that inherits from the
<code>type</code> class. With this sleight-of-hand you can control how classes
instantiate objects.</p>

<p>How? I'm so pleased you asked!</p>

<p>Override the new metaclass's <code>__new__</code> method.
Remember, this <code>__new__</code> method must return the return of a call
to the <code>type</code> class's <code>__new__</code> method so your new class
correctly instantiates a new object of the correct type.</p>

<p>Got it? Good!</p>
