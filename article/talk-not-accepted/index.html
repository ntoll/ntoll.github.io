    <p>In June I was contacted by a friend in the EuroPython community.</p>
<p>They were looking for articles about how to deal with rejection and what to do
when one's proposal for a conference talk wasn't accepted. Since they couldn't
find anything suitable, they asked ChatGPT for suggestions, and this is how it
responded:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/chat-gpt-not-accepted.png" title="Talk not accepted"></p>
<p>In an entirely predictable turn of events, <em>ChatGPT was wrong</em> (no such post
existed at that time), and so I puckishly proposed writing such a post. We
can't have ChatGPT telling lies can we?</p>
<p>This is it.</p>
<hr class="section_break">
<p>It is a rare privilege to find oneself in a community who genuinely cherish and
support the participation of all. Such company guarantees we encounter folk
who are different to ourselves: an opportunity to learn from each other's
contrasting backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. It's why <em>diversity is a
precondition for growth</em>: our worlds are mutually enlarged by our differences.</p>
<p>But this isn't an easy journey.</p>
<p>It takes compassion, empathy and thoughtfulness to nurture a safe space where
such encounters take place. Participants - through their actions, attitudes and
attention - embody and live the inclusive and open minded ethos necessary for
such a precious situation. This is a complex relationship
between the individual participant's personal outlook and the collective
<em>esprit de corps</em> that emerges from the aggregate contributions and
interactions of many different individuals.</p>
<p>Here's the challenge: it's not enough for a group to say they're inclusive,
open-minded and whatnot... that's just empty virtue signalling. Merely
"going through the motions" is an ignorant and insidious sort of cultural cargo
cult ~ <em>communication at the expense of community</em>. It happens far too often,
and normalizing such behaviour actively diminishes the possibility of a
genuinely inclusive and open-minded space.</p>
<p>Rather, such a community spirit springs
from the <em>quality of the interactions between individual participants</em>.
Sometimes such interactions are unavoidably painful: as when a proposed
contribution to a community event is rejected by the organisers.</p>
<p>Yet it is at these moments when embodiment by individuals, and the emergent
community spirit, are so important.</p>
<p>This equally applies both to organisers and participants.</p>
<p>If you are an organiser of a community event, and have a call for proposals but
limited space, then you will inevitably reject (and therefore exclude) some of
the proposed contributions. If you believe in a diverse and inclusive culture
then this process may feel deeply uncomfortable and paradoxical.</p>
<p>But this is the puzzle you face, and (I'm sorry to say) there's no right
answer.</p>
<p>Actually, the notion that there <em>is an answer</em> to such a situation is, I
believe, deeply flawed. Rather, <em>how you choose to conduct yourself, pay
attention to the situation and engage with the unfolding events</em> will reveal
your community's spirit. I hope you make a conscious personal decision to
choose compassion, empathy and thoughtfulness over going through the motions of
a performative brain dead cultural cargo cult.</p>
<p>Alternatively for participants, it can be deeply upsetting if your contribution
to an event has been rejected. All sorts of complicated feelings may come up
(although some may just shrug and move on). I want to reassure you that it is
natural and understandable to feel sad, disappointed or upset by such
rejection. Lean into such feelings and give them the time and space they
deserve. The worst thing you can do is ignore them.</p>
<p>Most importantly, pay attention to what happens next.</p>
<p>If the organisers of the event embody an inclusive and empowering community
spirit, their interactions with you will be affirmative, compassionate and
supportive. If you engage in good faith, such organisers will likely welcome
feedback or suggestions. But please remember they're human beings too and they
may respectfully disagree with you. This is what it is to be in a
diverse community - you'll meet folk with different outlooks to your own.</p>
<p>It's an opportunity to learn!</p>
<p>As an exercise in self-understanding and growth, you may want to
explore why your proposal was rejected (if this hasn't already been
explained). Such feedback is best received in a spirit of constructive
collaboration. You'll either discover how
to improve your next proposal or come to see how the event in question isn't a
good fit for what you want to contribute.</p>
<p>If the former, reflect and refine for next time.</p>
<p>If the latter, your niche might be elsewhere, so keep exploring!</p>
<p>If the event organisers are simply going through the motions, you'll know to
avoid the event in future.</p>
<p>In any case, be you an organiser of or participant in community events,
best of luck. Just remember flouishing and fulfilling communities are all about the quality
of individual interactions, something over which you have direct control: <em>how
<strong>you</strong> choose to participate</em>.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>
