    <p>We found our relaxing rhythm during the final few days of our holiday. Our lack
of a plan allowed us to follow our noses, and intuitively improvise an itinerary
during each day. As you'll see from the photos below, we spent a lot of time
focusing on four things: historic monuments, gardens, food and travel through
beautiful places.</p>
<p>Our tenth day started with breakfast in Ruthin, at Gail's coffee and tea rooms
on Upper Clwyd Street. Many of our stop overs have provided us with spectacular
food and drink, and the vegetarian full cooked breakfast at this modest and
out of the way cafe was up there with the best. Their friendly chef suggested
a few sights to see in Ruthin and furnished us with a map. And so our typical
modus operandi of chatting with locals and improvising on the spur of the
moment led us to the grounds of Ruthin castle.</p>

were a friendly bunch, and we were not disappointed to find several of them
displaying to the peahens.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa10/ruthin_castle_gardens.jpg" alt="Ruthin Castle gardens." title="Ruthin Castle gardens."><figcaption>Ruthin Castle gardens.</figcaption></figure><p>The castle itself was undergoing renovation, since the original fortified
remains had been converted into a stately pile during the 19th century, and
were now used as a hotel of some sort. With the abundance of dramatic castles
in this part of the world, it was inevitable we'd find a few that had been
repurposed.</p>
<p>Our chef at Gail's also suggested we visit the Ruthin Arts Centre, and we
spent an extended period of time wandering the relatively small but open plan
galleries. Both Mary and I particularly enjoyed the exhibition of
husband-and-wife artists
<a href="https://paulineburbidge-quilts.com/">Pauline Burbridge</a> and
<a href="https://charlespoulsenartwork.co.uk/">Charlie Poulsen</a>. We immersed ourselves
in the artworks and lost track of time... as we encountered the art in three
distinct phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>slow wandering around the exhibition as we let our intuition guide us as we
were drawn different pieces,</li>
<li>a sort of inquisitive "deep dive" as we read the prose attached to the
exhibitions and watched a couple of videos where the artists describe their
works, process and intents,</li>
<li>a recapitulation as we explore the exhibition one final time now that we're
more familiar with the pieces, the artists and the story being told.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa10/artwork.jpg" alt="A fragment from a Charlie Poulsen piece." title="A fragment from a Charlie Poulsen piece."><figcaption>A fragment from a Charlie Poulsen piece.</figcaption></figure><p>This was a wonderful state of mind to inhabit and we both wished there had
been more of this to explore and encounter.</p>
<p>Having put us both in a thoughtful mood, and given the glorious weather, Mary
suggested we go visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodnant_Garden">Bodnant garden</a>
to continue our pensive strolling. Since we had the car and we felt like
touring through North Wales, we instructed the sat-nav and slowly wound our way
to our destination.</p>
<p>We were not disappointed.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa10/bodnant_gardens.jpg" alt="Bodnant gardens." title="Bodnant gardens."><figcaption>Bodnant gardens.</figcaption></figure><p>We found ourselves in a large and
varied garden containing an abundance of benches on which we could both sit,
look, listen and soak up our surroundings. I think my favourite aspect of the
gardens were the woods containing paths and shallow brooks and many different
sorts of tree and woodland life.</p>
<p>As with the art gallery, our slow meandering meant we encountered and
re-encountered aspects of the garden in a manner that encouraged a slow and
thoughtful attention to all the ways the garden stimulated our senses: the
colourful floral displays, smell of pine, sound of running water or warmth of
the sun touching our faces.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa10/bodnant_gardens_terrace.jpg" alt="Bodnant gardens terraces." title="Bodnant gardens terraces."><figcaption>Bodnant gardens terraces.</figcaption></figure><p>In the evening we found ourselves staying at a community run inn that was
holding a quiz night. After an early dinner we joined the locals and had a
friendly evening answering questions about such diverse topics as the game of
Cluedo, Elton John's back catalogue, the plural noun for crows (it's a "murder"
of crows, in case you're wondering), and other out of the way trivia. The quiz
was both taken seriously, yet in a spirit of silliness, as many of the locals
made humorous commentary of the emerging themes in the questions.</p>
<p>Once again, our modus operandi of chatting with locals and improvising on the
spur of the moment led us to something fun.</p>
<p>Our penultimate day started with the realisation that it was our penultimate
day. So, we decided to make use of the car and go visit the seaside, since that
was the only type of terrain we'd not yet visited during our break. We chose to
head towards Porthmadoc since it would mean driving through the beautiful Welsh
mountain range called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowdonia">Snowdonia</a>.</p>
<p>The journey was, indeed a sight to behold as we made our way to the coast, yet
upon our arrival at Porthmadoc we both felt underwhelmed by the place.
Wondering what our options might be, and in the spirit of improvisation, we
spotted a castle on the coastline in the distance and pointed the car in that
general direction only to pick up signs for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlech_Castle">Harlech Castle</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa10/harlech_castle.jpg" alt="Harlech castle." title="Harlech castle."><figcaption>Harlech castle.</figcaption></figure><p>This well preserved ruin is an imposing sight so we imagined it would be very
busy with tourists, due to its prominence. Yet the village was relatively
empty and we easily got into the castle.</p>
<p>Not only was the castle an amazing sight, but the views from it were
magnificent as we were able to take in a full panorama from the Irish sea to
the mountains of Snowdonia.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa10/harlech_view.jpg" alt="The view of Snowdonia from Harlech." title="The view of Snowdonia from Harlech."><figcaption>The view of Snowdonia from Harlech.</figcaption></figure><p>Because of its good state of repair, it was possible to explore many different
parts of the castle. For instance, we walked up and down spiral staircases to
get to the battlements and then to the very highest tower. I'm OK with heights
but Mary (and several others) found the drop from the walls rather intimidating
and so we didn't spend <em>that</em> long up there. Luckily it was a bright sunny day
with little wind to speak of, otherwise I imagine the reaction of folks might
be very different.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa10/harlech_walls.jpg" alt="Walking the castle walls of Harlech." title="Walking the castle walls of Harlech."><figcaption>Walking the castle walls of Harlech.</figcaption></figure><p>As we were having our lunch we noticed a cameraman and several people faffing
about and talking about "positioning", "shots" and "delivery". One of them, a
lady in sunglasses, spotted us watching the events unfold and came over to
explain what was going on.</p>
<p>It turned out she and her colleague were professional story tellers
specialising in Welsh legends (particularly, the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabinogion">Mabinogion</a>), and were at Harlech to
tell stories in both English and beginner level Welsh, to help keep this
beautifully musical language alive. The UK's <a href="https://www.itv.com/">ITV news</a>
had turned up to do a short feature on their work and were just filming a
talking head segment in front of the castle before filming the actual story
telling in the castle.</p>
<p>We didn't realise such bardic activity was going on, but both of us love
listening to a well told yarn, so quickly finished our lunch and headed back
over the bridge into the castle.</p>
<p>Inside we found perhaps a hundred people sitting on benches, low walls and the
grass as our bespectacled friend started to tell us a story. I won't describe
stories she and her colleague told. Rather, I heartily encourage you to seek
out such folk and let them cast their magic. In our case, as they told their
tales in Harlech, the story tellers embodied and communicated the worlds they
described in a way that only an oral story teller can. The best special effects
happen as part of the story seen inside one's head, the interaction between the
story teller and their audience adds an extra dimension of connectivity to the
telling of tales that our screen laden world often lacks and, ultimately, our
stories are just that... connections between ourselves that deeply and
fundamentally move and speak to us through distances of time and space.</p>
<p>Here's the video segment broadcast by ITV, it is but a shadow cast by the
brilliance of their story telling:</p>

<p>We must have spent hours in the castle, since we both mentioned exploring the
village of Harlech at the same time. Almost immediately we discovered a small
ice cream shop, selling home made produce made earlier in the day. This was some
of the best ice cream either of us have ever tasted, and the owner explained how
she hand made the produce fresh each day. Clearly this woman had a passion
for ice cream, and we could taste it in abundance.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa10/mary_icecream.jpg" alt="Mary, with her amazing ice cream." title="Mary, with her amazing ice cream."><figcaption>Mary, with her amazing ice cream.</figcaption></figure><p>Just around the corner was an knick-knack shop in which I found a piano. On
the music stand was Debussy's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suite_bergamasque#3._Clair_de_lune">Clair de Lune</a> (which I know),
so I rattled it off, after finding a very convenient candelabra to help free up
a hand.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa10/nicholas_piano.jpg" alt="Nicholas on the piano, but where is his ice cream?" title="Nicholas on the piano, but where is his ice cream?"><figcaption>Nicholas on the piano, but where is his ice cream?</figcaption></figure><p>It was lovely to play after more than a week away, and I even got a round of
applause!</p>
<p>Upon leaving Harlech we decided to take the long and winding road over
the mountains of Snowdonia, just to take in the views and make space for
enjoying a slow and gently winding journey together.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa10/snowdonia.jpg" alt="Snowdonia." title="Snowdonia."><figcaption>Snowdonia.</figcaption></figure><p>On the morning of our final day (today), we finished the last of many full
breakfasts and set off for Prestatyn to conclude our walk.</p>
<figure><img src="../../images/offa10/offas_sign.jpg" alt="The sign to Chepstow." title="The sign to Chepstow."><figcaption>The sign to Chepstow.</figcaption></figure><p>Little did we realise, almost a fortnight ago, how different our adventure
along Offa's Dyke would be, compared to what we had imagined or prepared for.
We certainly enjoyed walking the first third of the trail (almost 60 miles),
and we both reflected that the injuries and improvised change to a touring
holiday had taught us a lesson: go with the flow, and unexpected change is to
be embraced and welcomed if you're going to make something of it.</p>

glad to have returned after our journey together. We're especially looking
forward to seeing our children again and giving them gifts we found on our way.</p>
<p>But I think this won't be the last time Mary and I do this.</p>
<p>We've had too much fun not to do it again.</p>
