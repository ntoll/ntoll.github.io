    <img src="../../static/images/transcode.jpg" alt="TransCode logo"><p>Over the weekend I had the privilege of attending the world's first
<a href="http://trans-code.org/">Trans*code</a> event in London. Trans*code is
a hack-day for transgender persons and trans-allies (like me).
We came together to create software that addresses transgender issues and
participate in introductory programming workshops for people not currently
familiar with the world of technology.</p>

<p>A hack-day is usually a community organised event centred around some form
of civic or community good. For example, I participate in and sometimes help
to organise the health-care related
<a href="http://nhshackday.com/">NHS Hackdays</a>, I organise the
<a href="http://pyconuk.org/education">education track</a> at PyconUK where we
run hack-day like workshops for teachers and developers for generating
educational resources and I've taken part in many post-conference
<a href="http://pyconuk.net/Sprints">sprints</a> where members of the
free-software community get together to plan and hack.</p>

<p>I strongly believe that wonderful things happen when diverse groups of
people get together to collaborate and solve problems: any cooperation that
brings about a cosmopolitan, tolerant and receptive world view should be
encouraged. After all, what's the alternative? I'd argue its an
obviously undesirable small-minded, prejudiced and unimaginative world view. I
also passionately believe that programming is a vehicle for empowerment and
emancipation. Our world is increasingly influenced and controlled by
computing so it is important that <strong>everyone</strong> has the
opportunity to take control of technology and make it <em>work for
them</em>.</p>

<p>However, the majority of such hack-days are attended by people like me -
white straight dudes who already write code. Therefore I have no hesitation
in supporting any effort that will increase diversity, participation and
understanding.</p>

<p>How did I find out about Trans*code? My main programming language
is Python, I'm a former teacher and I'm interested in education. I have
a buddy called <a href="https://twitter.com/NaomiCeder">Naomi</a> who is also
a Python programmer, former teacher and has an interest in education. She's
the organiser and force-of-nature behind Trans*code. Naomi put out the word
via various UK based Python channels and I was one of several Pythonists
attending as a trans-ally.</p>

<p>Briefly, here are my impressions of the day:</p>

<p>The transgender people I chatted with are brave. From my position of
ignorance I had no idea about some of the situations trans-folk have to deal
with and overcome on a regular basis.</p>

<p>It was a really friendly event. When there were disagreements people were
sympathetic and respectful. It's refreshing to encounter this sort of
deliberation rather than a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pissing_contest">pissing
contest</a> between silverback alpha-geeks.</p>

<p>I'm a naturally enthusiastic person and given only half a chance will talk
the hind-leg off a proverbial donkey, organise people and "get stuff
done". It's important to listen, especially given my position of
ignorance. I learned to frame my contributions as "have you thought
about X..?" type questions. I should do this more often.</p>

<p>My group were a lot of fun to work with. The idea was an application called
<a href="https://github.com/cmantito/transflare">TransFlare</a> a sort of
"bat signal" or "flare" mobile app for the trans community: in case of
trouble, use the application to call for help.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AaAmB.png" alt="Bat signal"></p>

<p>As far as I could tell, the most valuable part of the day was the debate,
idea generation and discussion we had rather than any coding we got done
(truth be told, I didn't do a lot of coding). We ended up thinking about a
lot of different things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identity verification - we investigated the
    <a href="https://openname.org/">OpenName</a> protocol to allow people to
    indicate the provenance of their identity online in a manner that wasn't
    controlled by some third party that may change its terms and conditions or
    decide to push some non-friendly agenda.</li>
    <li>Web of trust - a humane peer-to-peer community driven mechanism to
    verify that people were of good standing and appropriately qualified to
    be helpers (who ultimately see the flares that are generated).</li>
    <li>Appropriate technology - mobile, geo-enabled, encrypted and, where
    possible, peer-to-peer (so there is no single point of failure where
    sensitive details could be hacked).</li>
</ul>
<p>As a technical person, these are <em>really interesting problems</em> to
solve but with the advantage of having real use-cases to flesh out what can
sometimes be quite abstract problems.</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun and I hope my contribution was helpful.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Naomi and the other organisers, the sponsors
(<a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce.com</a> and
<a href="https://gocardless.com/">Go Cardless</a>) and the other attendees who
made the event such an interesting and stimulating occasion.</p>

<p>There are plans afoot to run another Trans*code
related event at this year's PyconUK in September in Coventry. I'd encourage
you to join in and support in any way that you can.</p>
