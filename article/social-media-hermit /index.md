I have deleted my Twitter account.

Why?

1. I no longer use it.
2. Social media isn't fun.
3. There are better ways to connect.
4. Retaining my account feels hypocritical.

Honestly, that's all there is to it (and it feels good).

Twitter encourages infantile, reactionary and shallow discourse. What do you
expect from a technology that enforces a 280 character limit and trains us to
read in bite size chunks? Twitter may as well enforce [other arbitrary
limitations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak), for example the exclusive
use of monosyllabic words.

I want no part of it.

If folks genuinely want to connect with me, they'll be in touch (as I will be
with them).

Peace.
