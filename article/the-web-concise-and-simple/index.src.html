<p>(As with all "<a href="/article/concise-and-simple">concise and simple</a>"
articles I assume no prior knowledge of the subject and keep the length to
less than 1500 words.)</p>

<p>The World Wide Web (or just "the web") is a global hypertext
system invented by <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Sir Tim
Berners-Lee</a> in 1989. The web is <strong>not</strong>
<a href="/article/internet-concise-and-simple">the Internet</a>. Rather, it
is an application that sends messages via the Internet. You're using it
now!</p>

<p>Hypertext is <em>the</em> core concept of the web: pages
containing text and other media reference each other via so-called
hyperlinks. In this way, pages connect to form a nebulous web of
relationships. Hypertext was coined in the 1960s by
<a href="http://ted.hyperland.com/">Ted Nelson</a> although the basic concept
dates back to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush">Vannevar Bush's</a> 1945
article,
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/?single_page=true">As We May Think</a>
where he describes an intriguing device called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">Memex</a>
(MEMory indEX). Various pre-web hypertext systems were developed in the 1960s,
70s and 80s, but it was only until the early 1990s that Berners-Lee's version
of hypertext became popular.</p>

<p>The web is made with these concepts:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page">Page</a> - a document
    on the web. Web pages can contain text, images, sound, video and forms
    (to facilitate limited interactivity).</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">Hyperlink</a> -
    something in a page that, when activated, takes the user
    to another page on the web. Often abbreviated to "link".</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url">URL</a> - a uniform
    resource location identifies a page or other resource on the web.</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">Browser</a> -
    software on the user's computer that downloads web pages, displays them
    and handles user interactions (such as filling in a form or clicking a
    link).</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">Server</a> -
    a device on the Internet that runs software to deliver web pages and other
    resources to browsers.</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP">HTTP</a> - HyperText
    Transfer Protocol describes how browsers and servers interact.</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> - HyperText
    Markup Language defines the structure of web pages identifying such things
    as paragraphs, links and headings.</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>
    - Cascading Style Sheets describe how a page should look by defining
    layout, colour scheme, typesetting and other presentation information.</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript">Javascript</a> -
    a ubiquitous programming language for browsers. It defines the behaviour
    of a page beyond the basics of clicking links or submitting forms.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the early days of the web HTML was the only way to create pages (CSS
and Javascript were later developments). The essence of HTML has not changed
over the years:</p>

<p>HTML is written as a series of <em>elements</em>. Elements are defined with
named <em>tags</em> between less-than (&lt;) and greater-than
(&gt;) symbols. The scope of an element is defined by an opening and
closing tag. For example, a heading is defined by the
<code>h1</code> element:</p>

<p><pre><code class="html">&lt;h1&gt;Hello&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre></p>

<p>The closing tag is just like the opening one apart from the prepended
back-slash (/). The tags are a balanced pair: the scope
of the heading element is defined as the text "Hello" and displayed as:</p>

<h1>Hello</h1>

<p>Elements can contain other elements but are not allowed to overlap:</p>

<p><pre><code class="html">&lt;p&gt;this is &lt;strong&gt;valid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre></p>

<p>but,</p>

<p><pre><code class="html">&lt;p&gt;this is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code></pre></p>

<p>HTML has a certain structure: two elements, <code>head</code> and
<code>body</code>, are contained within an <code>html</code> element.
Information about the document is expressed by elements within the
<code>head</code> tags. Elements within the <code>body</code>
tags define the structure of the page. For example:</p>

<p><pre><code class="html">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/styles.css"/&gt;
    &lt;meta name="author" content="Nicholas H.Tollervey"/&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is some text enclosed within a paragraph tag.
    I can link to &lt;a href="http://ntoll.org/"&gt;other docs&lt;/a&gt;
    using an anchor tag.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre></p>

<p>HTML is currently at version five (HTML5). Actually, HTML5 is
a collection of standards. Some add capabilities for embedding media while
others add new tags. HTML5 colloquially refers to specifications for new
browser behaviour too, such as local data storage.</p>

<p>Browsers were originally simple and merely text based applications, as
shown in the screenshot below. Despite these shortcomings the structure of the
page is very clear and easy to read (hyperlinks are green).</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/lynx.png" alt="Old skool web"/></p>

<p>The web "happens" in two places: the client's browser and the website's
server.</p>

<p>Clicking a link or typing in a URL makes your browser send a request
over the Internet using HTTP (as
<a href="/article/internet-concise-and-simple">described here</a>).
The server identified within the URL responds with HTML for the web page, CSS
describing how to display it and any Javascript needed for the page to function
correctly.</p>

<p>Before rendering the page to the screen the browser transforms the HTML
in to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">document object
model</a> (DOM). The DOM is a data structure used to match HTML elements
with CSS rules. Furthermore, snippets of Javascript run at certain points
in the page's existence and manipulate the DOM as events occur (such
as when the page finishes loading, a button is clicked or a form is
submitted).</p>

<p>As you interact with the browser it repeats this process to fetch new pages
from the websites you visit. Sometimes your browser <em>posts</em> information
back to a website (when you fill in a form). The website responds
with a page that reflects the information you submitted.</p>

<p>This happens within the realm of your "client" computer. However, an
equally interesting story happens on the server.</p>

<p>In the simplest case web pages are static so the server responds with
pre-existing content. However, many websites are dynamic and allow you to
change them on-the-fly. For example, as you browse a shopping website you may
click buttons that add items to a virtual shopping basket. If you visit the
web page that represents your basket you expect it to be up-to-date and list
the correct number of items.</p>

<p>For this to happen several things must be in place.</p>

<p><em>The server should know who you are</em>. You are authenticated in
some way, usually with a username and secret password, and authorised to
interact with certain pages. For example, only you should be able to view and
change your settings. Furthermore, the server must not confuse you with other
users, so your interaction with the website is associated with a unique
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_(computer_science)">session</a>
linked to your identity so the server can track who is making requests.</p>

<p><em>The server should keep track of state</em>. When you add an item to a
shopping cart this should be reflected in the way the website behaves. Such
state is stored in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> "backend".</p>

<p><em>The HTML should reflect the state stored in the database</em>. This is
achieved with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor">templates</a>:
snippets of HTML combined with data specific to the client.
Rendering templates to HTML is "frontend".
The following snippet is for a simple shopping basket (anything enclosed
within <code>{% raw %}{% %}{% endraw %}</code> is replaced):</p>

<p><pre><code class="html">{% raw %}&lt;h1&gt;Hi, {% user.username %}!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your shopping cart contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
{% for item in user.cart %}
  &lt;li&gt;{{item.name}} - {{item.description}}&lt;/li&gt;
{% endfor %}{% endraw %}
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre></p>

<p><em>The server should be reliable</em>. Between the front and back ends
is a <em>logic</em> layer checking requests, interacting
with the database and ensuring the correct HTML is served. This needs to work
correctly (imagine if, when clicking a "buy this item" button, a
website added two items rather than one).</p>

<p><em>The server should perform well</em>. A website should quickly
handle a great many requests at once. Two common ways to achieve good
performance are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)">caching</a> (store
and re-use things that take time to compute but don't change that much over
time) and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)">load
balancing</a> (route incoming calls to a pool of servers so the
workload is shared). Popular websites consist of many servers
handling specific tasks (such as the database, rendering templates or
the logic) hidden behind layers of load balancers and caches.</p>

<p>If this sounds complicated, that's because it is. However, the description
given above is a simplification of the amazing engineering that takes place
to display a web page on your screen.</p>

<p>However, all is not well.</p>

<p>Browsers implement web-standards in different ways:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer">Internet Explorer</a>
is famous for getting things wrong. HTML and CSS are more complex
with each revision - gone are the days of a beautifully simple hypertext
system. Competing technical standards are promoted for commercial rather than
engineering reasons and some are so complex they're practically useless. Alas,
Javascript is <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">hopelessly
unintuitive</a> and provides developers with plenty of rope with which to hang
themselves.</p>

<p>Finally, there are political problems.</p>

<p>You can't publish on the web unless you know how to
set up a website or you use a third party service such as a social
network. Social networks are hugely popular but turn the
web into a handful of walled gardens - the antithesis of the decentralised
early web. Furthermore, such websites track and analyse user
behaviour and sell it (via advertising). They also provide services for
storing user's digital assets (in order to harvest yet more data to
sell). As has been
<a href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/11/feudal-security/">pointed out
before</a>, this is deeply worrying.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it is a question of who controls the infrastructure.
Many users are happy to sacrifice privacy and control for ease of use and
convenience. Yet I wonder how many realise that they are tracked and
influenced by only a handful of very powerful technology companies.</p>

<p>What of the future? I like to think that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson">William Gibson</a> was
right when, in 1996
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/14/magazine/the-net-is-a-waste-of-time.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm">he said</a>,</p>

<blockquote>[T]he World Wide Web [is] the test pattern for whatever will become the dominant global medium.</blockquote>

<p>(Who knows what will happen next?)</p>
