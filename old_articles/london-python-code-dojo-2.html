	<p>Yesterday evening we had our second code dojo. </p>
	<p>About twenty attendees attempted to write a tic-tac-toe game and this time round we&#8217;d made some improvements:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A comfortable OS, keyboard and mouse (no more Macbook)</li>
		<li>A simple editor (gEdit) &#8211; no intimidation from vim/emacs this time</li>
		<li>Starting from scratch (no need to learn an API)</li>
		<li>Stream of thought explanations from the pilot (well done everyone)</li>
		<li>Prizes! (Thanks to Josette from <a href="http://oreilly.co.uk/">O&#8217;Reilly</a>)</li>
		<li>A wider range of food (thanks Marcus and <a href="http://www.fry-it.com/">Fry-IT</a>)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I personally think this dojo was better than the first for all sorts of reasons: we were better organised, the problem fitted better with the dojo &#8220;setup&#8221; and the stream of thought explanations from the pilots encouraged some great feedback, conversation and problem solving.</p>
	<p>Although we didn&#8217;t finish the problem I feel that this is a classic case of the journey being more important than the final destination.</p>
	<p>Congratulations to Ciar&aacute;n, Daniele and Menno on winning prizes (each pilot was encouraged to put their name into a prize draw &#8220;hat&#8221;). Ciar&aacute;n got the O&#8217;Reilly book, Daniele won the only autographed copy of <a href="http://www.ironpythoninaction.com/">Iron Python in Action</a> in existence (provided by the authors) and Menno went home with a book donated by Fry-IT by their business "muse" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Semler">Ricardo Semler</a>.</p>
	<p>At the end we had a quick round-up session where we provisionally decided that the next <span class="vevent"><span class="summary">London Code Dojo</span> will be more of the same: at the <span class="location">offices of <a href="http://www.fry-it.com">Fry-IT</a></span> with the aim of finishing the tic-tac-toe game. We originally thought of running it on the on the third Thursday of each month, but I now realise this will clash with the Pyssup &#8220;social&#8221; event. As a result I propose we run it on the first Thursday of each month with the next one being on the <abbr class="dtstart" title="2009-11-05T18:30:00">5th November at 6:30pm</abbr></span>.</p>
	<p>The next <span class="vevent"><span class="summary">London Python Pyssup</span> is happening next Wednesday (<abbr class="dtstart" title="2009-10-21T19:00:00">21st October, 7pm</abbr>) at <span class="location">The Blackfriar near Blackfriars tube</span>. Unfortunately I can&#8217;t make it but it&#8217;d be a good opportunity for those of us who can to plan and discuss the next dojo.</p>
