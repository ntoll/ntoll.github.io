	<p>I just found this video about open-mindedness, evidence based argument and common mistakes made when &#8220;moving between&#8221; thoughts in a discussion:</p>

	<p>I like its succinct presentation of what I was up to when I read for my philosophy degree: arguing a position and revising in the light of evidence. </p>
	<p>I get a real buzz from this sort of thing, whether it be in a debate, writing an essay or when reading <em>well written</em> philosophy. I  try to engage with an argument by poking holes in it &#8211; and I love how <em>good</em> authors / debaters will poke back. </p>
	<p>Unfortunately, there is an abundance of spaghetti philosophy: like spaghetti code in software engineering it is badly presented, too complex, opaque and not quite fit for purpose. </p>
	<p>This video is a great example of what good philosophy should be: well presented, no more complex than it needs to be, inviting scrutiny and encouraging the audience to engage and to <em>think</em>.</p>
