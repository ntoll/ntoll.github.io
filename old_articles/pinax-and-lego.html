	<p>I met up with <a href="http://jtauber.com/" rel="friend met">James Tauber</a> yesterday morning. We had lots to talk about, one subject being how you explain <a href="http://pinaxproject.com/">Pinax</a> to developers. We had a lot of fun creating an analogy with Lego (best toy ever invented IMHO).</p>

	<p>Lego bricks and your imagination are all you need to build interesting toys. In our analogy, <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> is Lego bricks: it gives you the building blocks you need to build interesting things on the web. </p>
	<p>Yet rather than building from scratch each time you want to create a toy you can buy off-the-shelf Lego sets for the most common types: cars, trucks, space-ships, movie themed locations, towns and so on&#8230; </p>
	<p>Pinax is a collection of Lego sets: it gives you a set of off-the-shelf components commonly used in web-development: a wiki, OpenID, Twitter clone and so on&#8230; </p>
	<p>What&#8217;s more, Lego sets are themed and interchangeable and if you really want to do something &#8220;out there&#8221; you can break them all down to the brick level and re-use only what you need. Pinax&#8217;s applications are &#8220;themed&#8221; (social networking, CMS, messaging etc), interchangeable and, should you want to do something extremely bespoke, they&#8217;re open-source so you can re-use only what you need.</p>
	<p>Voila, now even my four year old son can understand what I&#8217;m up to! :-)</p>
