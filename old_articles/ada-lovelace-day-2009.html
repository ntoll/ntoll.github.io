	<p>Today is Ada Lovelace day. You can find out about what this means by looking at the website: <a href="http://findingada.com">http://findingada.com</a>.</p>
	<p>Put simply, I signed <a href="http://www.pledgebank.com/AdaLovelaceDay">a pledge</a> to, <cite>&#8220;publish a blog post today about a woman in technology whom I admire&#8221;</cite>. I hope there are many more events like this.</p>
	<p>So, on to my post:</p>
	<p>The subject of my post isn&#8217;t a woman nor <em>in</em> technology. She&#8217;s my seven-year-old daughter and I want to describe a positive experience we shared <em>in</em> technology.</p>
	<p>Like many children her age Penelope has used software such as a <a href="http://openoffice.org">word-processor</a> for writing letters to grandparents and <a href="http://www.tuxpaint.org/">painting software</a> for all sorts of interesting creations. </p>
	<p>However, Penelope was curious about what <em>I</em> did all day sitting in front of my computer: was I drawing pictures? writing letters? playing games? I explained that I designed and wrote software, <cite>&#8220;er&#8230; I write in a special computer language that tells it what I want it to do.&#8221;</cite></p>
	<p><cite>&#8220;Can I try?&#8221;</cite> was the inevitable response. </p>
	<p>Remembering back to my own school days, I looked up the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/">Logo computer language</a>. </p>
	<p>We spent a couple of hours playing together, she at the keyboard with me looking over her shoulder. She quickly learned how to control the &#8220;turtle&#8221; on the screen and then came to the realization that <strong>she</strong> could make the computer do interesting stuff that nobody else had thought of before. </p>
	<p>We talked about some interesting maths: the concept of an algorithm (a recipe for getting stuff done), basic geometry (lines, points and angles) and basic flow control (repeat). We even managed to draw a box-flower:</p>
<pre>
<code>
    to sqr
        repeat 4 [fd 100 rt 90]
    end
    repeat 36 [sqr rt 10] 
</code>
</pre>
	<p><em>(draw a box, turn x degrees and repeat 360/x)</em></p>
	<p>In the end Penelope was so excited we couldn&#8217;t get her to go to sleep (we were doing this instead of bed-time story). </p>
	<p>I want to draw your attention to the excitement that Penelope felt.</p>
	<p>Like me, she now sees how much fun it can be to &#8220;create&#8221; on a computer. </p>
	<p>The fact that she is a girl isn&#8217;t (and shouldn&#8217;t) be special. Unfortunately, women in technology are rare (I&#8217;ve <strong>never</strong> worked with a female developer and only worked with three female software architects). This is a problem because gender has nothing to do with the ability to create software. I can only assume that there is something cultural going on. </p>
	<p>In conclusion, I hope that Penelope retains her sense of wonder at the creative potential locked away in computers rather than view technology as just another &#8220;boy thing&#8221;.</p>
