	<p>On the 27th of October my current contract as a software consultant comes to an end. I will then take a holiday from working for other people and spend the next four or five weeks working for myself. </p>
	<p>This is what I am going to do with my time (in no particular order):</p>
	<h2>The World&#8217;s Easiest Candidate Management System</h2>
	<p>For the past twelve months I have been contracted to produce bespoke vacancy / applicant management systems and job-site portals. My impression of this market is that the products on offer are overly complex, difficult to use, expensive and cumbersome.</p>
	<p>As a result I&#8217;m going to develop a web-based candidate management system that is:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Simple and elegant in form and function</li>
		<li>Easy to use and learn</li>
		<li>Cheap </li>
		<li>Agile and adaptable to user&#8217;s requirements</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I intend to write such a system by concentrating on <em>only</em> the essential features required in the process of filling a job vacancy and presenting these features as <em>simply and elegantly as possible</em>.</p>
	<p>In order to save time and effort, this project will share a lot of code with:</p>
	<h2>TeacherTool.org</h2>
	<p>The concept of TeacherTool.org has evolved from a &#8220;Learning Management System&#8221; (LMS) with wiki-like features into a collaboration tool for the creation and distribution of an open and evolving curriculum. </p>
	<p>TeacherTool.org will be released under a free-software licence with the aim of fostering a community of developers as well as users.</p>
	<h2>Program# v2.0 and ProgramR Chatterbots</h2>
	<p>My original Program# AIML chatterbot is definitely long in the tooth. The fact that it was my first project in C# also means that it does not make full use of the features available to a developer in the .NET and MONO platforms. </p>
	<p>ProgramR is another AIML based chatterbot but written in the Ruby programming language. Ruby is wonderfully powerful and I am very excited about using it in this project.</p>
	<p>I aim to provide updates of both versions of these AIML bots. I&#8217;ll then use them as the foundations for my own &#8220;modifications&#8221; to the basic AIML standard.</p>
	<h2>A Web-Based Expert System</h2>
	<p>I&#8217;ve already written an expert system in a previous role as Artitificial Intelligence developer. It was built to meet a very specific need in an even more specific way and made use of custom &#8220;in-house&#8221; tools for doing so. </p>
	<p>On reflection this was a bad thing to do: the expert system could have been a generic and standards-based product show-cased within the company&#8217;s other products and delivered as a subscription service to customers. This lack of vision (on my own and my then employer&#8217;s part) means that I now have the opportunity to start again and learn from these mistakes.</p>
	<p>The expert system I am about to write is a complete re-design and re-implementation in .NET 2.0 with a SQL2005 backend. It will be the expert-system as it should have been. Delivered through a simple web-service based API and a web-based interface (with perhaps even a multi-platform smart-client). I aim to make it a classic example of software as a service.</p>
	<h2>Learn Lisp</h2>
	<p>Something I&#8217;ve always wanted to do but never had the time or opportunity.</p>
	<p>I want to experiment with musical composition software. This seems like an ideal opportunity to add this fascinating language to my box of tricks as it strikes me that Lisp is a language well suited to solving the problems encountered in algorithmic music composition. </p>

	</ul>
	<p>I realise that I won&#8217;t be able to do all these activities in the time span I&#8217;ve allowed so my next task is to prioritise this list and plan exactly what I&#8217;m going to do. I&#8217;ll save that job for another post &#8211; although all the &#8220;Continue to&#8230;&#8221; items will definitely be in there.</p>
