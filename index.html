    <p>I had a wonderful time at <a href="https://ep2022.europython.eu/">EuroPython</a>, last
week, in Dublin.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of the conference, for me personally, involved giving
my talk entitled "Music and Code". It was an opportunity for me to reveal and
explore how I feel about programming, teaching and learning and the place of
tech in our wider culture. I've wanted to give a talk like this for over ten
years, but only recently have I figured out how to express what I wanted to say
through music as a metaphor.</p>
<div class="video-container">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4McW0mrONLo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>Another important aspect of the conference was friendship and it was a huge
pleasure to be a small part of the organising team.</p>
<p>I especially
want to highlight collaborating with <a href="https://blog.europython.eu/humans-of-europython-vicky/">Vicky</a>
(a remarkable friend who embodies so many of the wonderful aspects of our
Python community: a pro-active "can do" attitude, an inclusive and
compassionate outlook towards others, and a formidable determination to
thoughtfully do "the right thing" for the benefit of the whole community). The
two of us flapped and faffed to fulfil a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture">Maker</a> space within EuroPython.
Given the amount of positive engagement from attendees, I hope this becomes a
regular feature of the conference. A case in point being the DIY robots
competing to solve a maze in the fastest time, organised by the energetic and
enthusiastic folks at the <a href="http://niraspberryjam.com/">Northern Ireland Jam</a>:</p>
<div class="video-container">

</div>

<p>I also want to mention <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/boyang-dou/">Raquel</a>, who
chaired this year's EuroPython. Her clear leadership, <em>from the front</em>, her
apparently infinite energy, <em>displayed through her considerable efforts</em>, and
her humane connection with folks, <em>embodied by her patience, friendliness and
compassion</em> are generous gifts she has shared with us all. I sincerely hope
she's taking some post-conference time off, and I want to thank her for
reaching out to me, all those months ago, to become a part of organising
EuroPython. And I have to say all my fellow organisers were an absolute joy to
work with. Their collective courtesy, hard work, enthusiasm and friendliness is
a very rare and special thing that I hope we can sustain, nourish and
cultivate.</p>
<p>One other group of friends deserves a mention - my fellow maintainers of
<a href="https://codewith.mu/">the Mu code editor</a>. It was a huge amount of fun for us
to be together in the same place for the first time ever. I was especially
delighted to meet <a href="https://github.com/xbecas">Vasco</a>, face to face, for the
first time.</p>
<p>The final part of EuroPython were two days of "code sprints", where open-source
collaborators work together on their projects, meet to discuss technical and
other aspects of our collective work, and welcome new collaborators and friends
to our efforts. We, the maintainers of Mu, had a wonderful time focusing on
Mu related things, and collaborating with new contributors who have made
welcome enhancements to Mu.</p>
<p>Here's a picture of all the Mu maintainers at EuroPython:</p>
<figure><img src="images/mu_maintainers.jpg" alt="The five core Mu maintainers" title="The five core Mu maintainers"><figcaption>The five core Mu maintainers:
<a href="https://github.com/tjguk">Tim</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tmontes">Tiago</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/carlosperate">Carlos</a>,
myself and
<a href="https://github.com/xbecas">Vasco</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, I heard many wonderful talks, enjoyed the conversations with many
friends old and new in the famous corridor track and took part in some really
stimulating workshops (with my amazing daughter, who was attending her first
PyCon as a proper attendee with an interest in data science - she especially
enjoyed both
<a href="https://djangogirls.org/en/dublin/">Django Girls</a> and
<a href="https://ep2022.europython.eu/humble-data">Humble Data</a>).</p>
<p>I love EuroPython's culturally cosmopolitan feeling, something that's hard to
recreate at a national PyCon. I love how folks keep coming back to EuroPython,
there are people who mean a lot to me, who I only ever see at this conference.
I also love EuroPython's peripatetic nature, as a community we are welcomed to
all sorts of fun places and have an opportunity to soak up the vibe of
different countries and cultures.</p>
<p>Long may it last, and I hope to see you at next year's EuroPython.</p>

    <p>I have been a freelance software engineer for almost 17 years. In that time, as
is usual for a freelancer, I have changed roles every 18 months to two years.
Often I took time off between gigs to work on personal projects, write, reflect
or learn something new. For instance, in 2008 I left my role as a senior .NET
developer for an investment bank in London to learn Python, then reset my
career as a junior Python coder three months later and never looked back.</p>
<p>I've relished my freedom and independence, and it has been a privilege to work
on a huge variety of projects for a diverse range of companies in many
different sectors. I have been enriched by my colleagues, made many wonderful
friends, and learned a huge amount from folks.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone.</p>
<p>Yet change is in the air... Since January I've been in discussions with
<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> and from today (the Northern Hemisphere's
summer solstice no less!), I'm delighted to reveal I'll be joining them as
a principal engineer. Long may the sun shine on this endeavour. 🌞</p>
<p>The <em>very</em> big change for me and my family is that I'm an employee rather than
freelancer.</p>
<p>A big factor in persuading me to step away from freelancing were the folks I
met in interviews and the company culture I encountered leading up to my offer
of employment.</p>
<p>Another important factor was the nature of the work I'll be doing. I can't go
into details, but I'm very excited to work with an exceptionally talented group
of folks, on something that I'll relish getting my teeth into. Importantly, it
is an opportunity for me to bring together and use skills from many different
aspects of my background.</p>
<p>Finally, Anaconda understand what motivates folks passionate about creative
coding: I'll still be active as an open source contributor and will continue to
develop projects such as <a href="https://codegrades.com/">CodeGrades</a> in my own time,
as has been the case so far.  </p>
<p>Here's to new adventures.</p>

    <p>We found our relaxing rhythm during the final few days of our holiday. Our lack
of a plan allowed us to follow our noses, and intuitively improvise an itinerary
during each day. As you'll see from the photos below, we spent a lot of time
focusing on four things: historic monuments, gardens, food and travel through
beautiful places.</p>
<p>Our tenth day started with breakfast in Ruthin, at Gail's coffee and tea rooms
on Upper Clwyd Street. Many of our stop overs have provided us with spectacular
food and drink, and the vegetarian full cooked breakfast at this modest and
out of the way cafe was up there with the best. Their friendly chef suggested
a few sights to see in Ruthin and furnished us with a map. And so our typical
modus operandi of chatting with locals and improvising on the spur of the
moment led us to the grounds of Ruthin castle.</p>
<figure><img src="images/offa10/ruthin_castle_display.jpg" alt="Peacocks in the gardens of Ruthin Castle." title="Peacocks in the gardens of Ruthin Castle."><figcaption>Peacocks in the gardens of Ruthin Castle.</figcaption></figure><p>The chef at Gail's had explained the peacocks who live in the castle grounds
were a friendly bunch, and we were not disappointed to find several of them
displaying to the peahens.</p>
<figure><img src="images/offa10/ruthin_castle_gardens.jpg" alt="Ruthin Castle gardens." title="Ruthin Castle gardens."><figcaption>Ruthin Castle gardens.</figcaption></figure><p>The castle itself was undergoing renovation, since the original fortified
remains had been converted into a stately pile during the 19th century, and
were now used as a hotel of some sort. With the abundance of dramatic castles
in this part of the world, it was inevitable we'd find a few that had been
repurposed.</p>
<p>Our chef at Gail's also suggested we visit the Ruthin Arts Centre, and we
spent an extended period of time wandering the relatively small but open plan
galleries. Both Mary and I particularly enjoyed the exhibition of
husband-and-wife artists
<a href="https://paulineburbidge-quilts.com/">Pauline Burbridge</a> and
<a href="https://charlespoulsenartwork.co.uk/">Charlie Poulsen</a>. We immersed ourselves
in the artworks and lost track of time... as we encountered the art in three
distinct phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>slow wandering around the exhibition as we let our intuition guide us as we
were drawn different pieces,</li>
<li>a sort of inquisitive "deep dive" as we read the prose attached to the
exhibitions and watched a couple of videos where the artists describe their
works, process and intents,</li>
<li>a recapitulation as we explore the exhibition one final time now that we're
more familiar with the pieces, the artists and the story being told.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="images/offa10/artwork.jpg" alt="A fragment from a Charlie Poulsen piece." title="A fragment from a Charlie Poulsen piece."><figcaption>A fragment from a Charlie Poulsen piece.</figcaption></figure><p>This was a wonderful state of mind to inhabit and we both wished there had
been more of this to explore and encounter.</p>
<p>Having put us both in a thoughtful mood, and given the glorious weather, Mary
suggested we go visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodnant_Garden">Bodnant garden</a>
to continue our pensive strolling. Since we had the car and we felt like
touring through North Wales, we instructed the sat-nav and slowly wound our way
to our destination.</p>
<p>We were not disappointed.</p>
<figure><img src="images/offa10/bodnant_gardens.jpg" alt="Bodnant gardens." title="Bodnant gardens."><figcaption>Bodnant gardens.</figcaption></figure><p>We found ourselves in a large and
varied garden containing an abundance of benches on which we could both sit,
look, listen and soak up our surroundings. I think my favourite aspect of the
gardens were the woods containing paths and shallow brooks and many different
sorts of tree and woodland life.</p>
<p>As with the art gallery, our slow meandering meant we encountered and
re-encountered aspects of the garden in a manner that encouraged a slow and
thoughtful attention to all the ways the garden stimulated our senses: the
colourful floral displays, smell of pine, sound of running water or warmth of
the sun touching our faces.</p>
<figure><img src="images/offa10/bodnant_gardens_terrace.jpg" alt="Bodnant gardens terraces." title="Bodnant gardens terraces."><figcaption>Bodnant gardens terraces.</figcaption></figure><p>In the evening we found ourselves staying at a community run inn that was
holding a quiz night. After an early dinner we joined the locals and had a
friendly evening answering questions about such diverse topics as the game of
Cluedo, Elton John's back catalogue, the plural noun for crows (it's a "murder"
of crows, in case you're wondering), and other out of the way trivia. The quiz
was both taken seriously, yet in a spirit of silliness, as many of the locals
made humorous commentary of the emerging themes in the questions.</p>
<p>Once again, our modus operandi of chatting with locals and improvising on the
spur of the moment led us to something fun.</p>
<p>Our penultimate day started with the realisation that it was our penultimate
day. So, we decided to make use of the car and go visit the seaside, since that
was the only type of terrain we'd not yet visited during our break. We chose to
head towards Porthmadoc since it would mean driving through the beautiful Welsh
mountain range called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowdonia">Snowdonia</a>.</p>
<p>The journey was, indeed a sight to behold as we made our way to the coast, yet
upon our arrival at Porthmadoc we both felt underwhelmed by the place.
Wondering what our options might be, and in the spirit of improvisation, we
spotted a castle on the coastline in the distance and pointed the car in that
general direction only to pick up signs for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlech_Castle">Harlech Castle</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="images/offa10/harlech_castle.jpg" alt="Harlech castle." title="Harlech castle."><figcaption>Harlech castle.</figcaption></figure><p>This well preserved ruin is an imposing sight so we imagined it would be very
busy with tourists, due to its prominence. Yet the village was relatively
empty and we easily got into the castle.</p>
<p>Not only was the castle an amazing sight, but the views from it were
magnificent as we were able to take in a full panorama from the Irish sea to
the mountains of Snowdonia.</p>
<figure><img src="images/offa10/harlech_view.jpg" alt="The view of Snowdonia from Harlech." title="The view of Snowdonia from Harlech."><figcaption>The view of Snowdonia from Harlech.</figcaption></figure><p>Because of its good state of repair, it was possible to explore many different
parts of the castle. For instance, we walked up and down spiral staircases to
get to the battlements and then to the very highest tower. I'm OK with heights
but Mary (and several others) found the drop from the walls rather intimidating
and so we didn't spend <em>that</em> long up there. Luckily it was a bright sunny day
with little wind to speak of, otherwise I imagine the reaction of folks might
be very different.</p>
<figure><img src="images/offa10/harlech_walls.jpg" alt="Walking the castle walls of Harlech." title="Walking the castle walls of Harlech."><figcaption>Walking the castle walls of Harlech.</figcaption></figure><p>As we were having our lunch we noticed a cameraman and several people faffing
about and talking about "positioning", "shots" and "delivery". One of them, a
lady in sunglasses, spotted us watching the events unfold and came over to
explain what was going on.</p>
<p>It turned out she and her colleague were professional story tellers
specialising in Welsh legends (particularly, the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabinogion">Mabinogion</a>), and were at Harlech to
tell stories in both English and beginner level Welsh, to help keep this
beautifully musical language alive. The UK's <a href="https://www.itv.com/">ITV news</a>
had turned up to do a short feature on their work and were just filming a
talking head segment in front of the castle before filming the actual story
telling in the castle.</p>
<p>We didn't realise such bardic activity was going on, but both of us love
listening to a well told yarn, so quickly finished our lunch and headed back
over the bridge into the castle.</p>
<p>Inside we found perhaps a hundred people sitting on benches, low walls and the
grass as our bespectacled friend started to tell us a story. I won't describe
stories she and her colleague told. Rather, I heartily encourage you to seek
out such folk and let them cast their magic. In our case, as they told their
tales in Harlech, the story tellers embodied and communicated the worlds they
described in a way that only an oral story teller can. The best special effects
happen as part of the story seen inside one's head, the interaction between the
story teller and their audience adds an extra dimension of connectivity to the
telling of tales that our screen laden world often lacks and, ultimately, our
stories are just that... connections between ourselves that deeply and
fundamentally move and speak to us through distances of time and space.</p>
<p>Here's the video segment broadcast by ITV, it is but a shadow cast by the
brilliance of their story telling:</p>
<div class="video-container">

</div>

<p>We must have spent hours in the castle, since we both mentioned exploring the
village of Harlech at the same time. Almost immediately we discovered a small
ice cream shop, selling home made produce made earlier in the day. This was some
of the best ice cream either of us have ever tasted, and the owner explained how
she hand made the produce fresh each day. Clearly this woman had a passion
for ice cream, and we could taste it in abundance.</p>
<figure><img src="images/offa10/mary_icecream.jpg" alt="Mary, with her amazing ice cream." title="Mary, with her amazing ice cream."><figcaption>Mary, with her amazing ice cream.</figcaption></figure><p>Just around the corner was an knick-knack shop in which I found a piano. On
the music stand was Debussy's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suite_bergamasque#3._Clair_de_lune">Clair de Lune</a> (which I know),
so I rattled it off, after finding a very convenient candelabra to help free up
a hand.</p>
<figure><img src="images/offa10/nicholas_piano.jpg" alt="Nicholas on the piano, but where is his ice cream?" title="Nicholas on the piano, but where is his ice cream?"><figcaption>Nicholas on the piano, but where is his ice cream?</figcaption></figure><p>It was lovely to play after more than a week away, and I even got a round of
applause!</p>
<p>Upon leaving Harlech we decided to take the long and winding road over
the mountains of Snowdonia, just to take in the views and make space for
enjoying a slow and gently winding journey together.</p>

along Offa's Dyke would be, compared to what we had imagined or prepared for.
We certainly enjoyed walking the first third of the trail (almost 60 miles),
and we both reflected that the injuries and improvised change to a touring
holiday had taught us a lesson: go with the flow, and unexpected change is to
be embraced and welcomed if you're going to make something of it.</p>

glad to have returned after our journey together. We're especially looking

<p>We've had too much fun not to do it again.</p>

    <p>Since we are supposed to be on a walking holiday, Mary and I decided to try
out a shorter walk, and one with which we were familiar, on day 7. We were in
Mary's part of the world (the beautiful Shropshire hills) and so we found
ourselves driving to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiperstones">Stiperstones</a>.</p>
<figure><img src="images/offa7/stiperselfie.jpg" alt="The two of us walking along the ridge at Stiperstones." title="The two of us walking along the ridge at Stiperstones"><figcaption>The two of us on the ridge at Stiperstones.</figcaption></figure><p>We arrived relatively early in the morning and easily found a parking space,
gingerly put on our boots and started to make our ascent. Given we were both
injured in some sense (me with my blisters and Mary with her knee) we went at a
slow and steady pace.</p>
<figure><img src="images/offa7/stiperstones.jpg" alt="An outcrop at Stiperstones." title="An outcrop at Stiperstones"><figcaption>An outcrop at Stiperstones.</figcaption></figure><p>Once at the top of the ridge (one of the highest points in Shropshire), the
outcrops of quartzite rock make obvious waypoints for hiking. We found several
folks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering">bouldering</a> on the rock
formations and paused to watch them and take in the glorious views and drink in
the fresh clear air.</p>
<figure><img src="images/offa7/underfoot.jpg" alt="Conditions underfoot at Stiperstones." title="Conditions underfoot at Stiperstones"><figcaption>Very poor conditions under foot at Stiperstones.</figcaption></figure><p>Conditions underfoot on many parts of the ridge are not good, and it's easy to
go over on one's ankle or painfully stub a toe.</p>
<p>Our slowness was thus more compounded by both the injuries and rough-shod rocks
strewn all over the paths. Yet we made progress and walked the full extent of
the ridge in glorious sunshine and accompanied by larks chirruping
away:</p>
<blockquote>
<q>He rises and begins to round,<br>
He drops the silver chain of sound<br>
Of many links without a break,<br>
In chirrup, whistle, slur and shake,<br>
All intervolv’d and spreading wide,<br>
Like water-dimples down a tide<br>
Where ripple ripple overcurls<br>
And eddy into eddy whirls;</q><br><br><cite><a href="https://allpoetry.com/The-Lark-Ascending">The Lark Ascending</a> ~ George Meredith</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>All told we walked almost five miles:</p>
<div id="map-day7" style="height: 400px"></div>

<p>In the afternoon we visited the small town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop's_Castle">Bishop's Castle</a>,
having heard the high street contained a number of book shops and a
<a href="https://poetrypharmacy.co.uk/">Poetry Pharmacy</a>, which sounded like it was
just what we needed.</p>
<figure><img src="images/offa7/bishops-castle.jpg" alt="Bishop's Castle high street." title="Bishop's Castle high street."><figcaption>The high street at Bishop's Castle - including a poetry pharmacy.</figcaption></figure><p>In the end we spent most of our time in the wonderful <a href="https://www.hocmuseum.org.uk/">House on Crutches Museum</a>
where I was able to examine some of the old brass instruments from the former
town band (not in a good state), and learn all about local
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_dance">Morris dancing</a> troupes.</p>
<p>The poetry pharmacy was another highlight, although I was unable to find
anything to read that suited my mood. Perhaps, given that I usually have my
nose in a book, this holiday is also a holiday from reading.</p>
<p>In the evening we stayed near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welshpool">Welshpool</a>
and found evidence of the local knitting circle's guerilla Easter decoration
operation:</p>
<figure><img src="images/offa7/welshpool.jpg" alt="Easter knitting in Welshpool." title="Easter knitting in Welshpool."><figcaption>Easter knitting in Welshpool.</figcaption></figure><p>The next day started with a drive to lake Vyrnwy (you pronounce it,
"ver-in-wee"). The lake is man-made and to reach the car park involves crossing
this rather imposing dam.</p>
<figure><img src="images/offa7/vyrnwy-dam.jpg" alt="The dam at Lake Vyrnwy." title="The dam at Lake Vyrnwy."><figcaption>The imposing dam at Lake Vyrnwy.</figcaption></figure><p>We timed our arrival perfectly since the car park was empty and hardly anyone
appeared to be around.</p>
<p>We decided to walk around the lake until we found a quiet beach on which we
could sit, relax and simply ponder the world. It can't have taken more than 20
minutes to find such an isolated spot, and we spent over two hours just
chatting, relaxing or throwing skimmers into the lake.</p>
<p>Over the course of the morning we were joined by various passers-by: a young
family, a Polish couple with their daughter, a group of students. Everyone was
friendly and happy to be by the lakeside and the opportunity for moments of
reflection that it offered.</p>
<figure><img src="images/offa7/lake-vyrnwy.jpg" alt="Lake Vyrnwy." title="Lake Vyrnwy."><figcaption>Lake Vyrnwy.</figcaption></figure><p>On our walk back to the car we appeared to meet a bank holiday weekend tour for
the "young fellers with souped-up cars" motoring club. The sound of noisy
exhausts, the look of go-faster stripes and the thinness of sports tyres
(clearly, for country roads) were much in evidence. A massive traffic jam was
also in evidence as the posse (what is the correct plural noun?) of young men
in souped up cars, took on the overweight hairy bikers and caravan owners in a
three way battle for the junction leading to the dam. It wasn't a pretty sight
as helpful bikers attempted to direct the traffic, only to be ignored by one of
the other tribes (in the end, the old fellers just stood in the way of the
traffic to control the flow). Well, done to the hairy bikers for their public
service!</p>
<p>We took our time getting back to the car, not wishing to be involved in the
traffic chaos, but in the end the blockages had been cleared and the route to
the dam was clear.</p>
<p>We ended up driving to our overnight rest stop at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llanymynech">Llanymynech</a>
and spent some time exploring the remains of the lime industry in the area.
This included a lovely walk in some woods reclaiming the area used for
processing and delivering treated lime into barges on the Shropshire Union
canal. Among the thickets we found a huge abandoned lime kiln.</p>
<figure><img src="images/offa7/lime-kilns.jpg" alt="Lime kilns in Llanymynech." title="Lime kilns in Llanymynech."><figcaption>Lime kilns in Llanymynech.</figcaption></figure><p>Today started with a trip to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirk_Castle">Chirk Castle</a>.</p>
<p>As members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Trust">National Trust</a>
we got in for free and spent the morning wandering the amazing gardens and
grounds.</p>
<figure><img src="images/offa7/chirk_castle.jpg" alt="Chirk Castle." title="Chirk Castle."><figcaption>Chirk Castle.</figcaption></figure><p>The gardens ranged from managed woodland to formal gardens with statues and
topiary.</p>
<figure><img src="images/offa7/chirk_formal_gardens.jpg" alt="Chirk gardens." title="Chirk gardens."><figcaption>Chirk gardens.</figcaption></figure><p>Inside the castle were displays depicting different aspects of the castle's
history, including the dungeon, the clockwork for the clock tower, the
servant's hall and a collection of knight's helmets. These final items made
me smile, as each helmet appears to bear a different expression, much like a
medieval metal emoji.</p>
<figure><img src="images/offa7/helmet_emoji.jpg" alt="A selection of knight's helmets." title="A selection of knight's helmets."><figcaption>A selection of knight's helmets.</figcaption></figure><p>In the afternoon we visited the town of Llangollen. It being bank holiday
Monday, the small town was heaving with visitors (like us) and the tourist
traps were doing a swift trade.</p>
<p>A highlight was watching canoeists tackle the Dee river running through the
town (they had hung slalom gates over the river). This led us to the railway
station, run by volunteer enthusiasts, and we ended up escaping the scrum of
tourists by taking a trip up the valley in an open train to the village of
Berwyn.</p>
<figure><img src="images/offa7/llangollen.jpg" alt="The river Dee at Llangollen." title="The river Dee at Llangollen."><figcaption>The river Dee at Llangollen.</figcaption></figure><p>As we enter the final stretch of our holiday, we're both starting to feel like
all this relaxing and touring is quite tiring. It means our holiday has done
its job: we're looking forward to throwing ourselves back into our usual day to
day routines.</p>
