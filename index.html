<h3>Why Computers Work (part 1)</h3>
<p>This is the first of five short blog posts exploring <em>why computers work</em>.</p>
<p>I'm going to present a friendly introductory overview for laypeople, from zero
to Turing machines, automata, abstraction and more. My aim is conciseness and
clarity, so I've necessarily missed out, glossed over and simplified things.
There are plenty of more advanced resources online should you wish to
investigate this subject further.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I hope to stimulate your thinking about computers by creating
a place to explore ideas.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy these articles and, as always, I love getting constructive
feedback <a href="contact">via email</a>. Unless otherwise stated, all images and
diagrams were created by the author.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Computers are ubiquitous.</p>
<p>They touch all aspects of our lives, from mediating our social interactions to
modelling aspects of our culture and managing the everyday infrastructure of
society.</p>
<p>Therefore, computers are interesting and, understandably, folks want to
know <strong>how</strong> the machines that automate and control so much of our world work.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q" target="_blank">This is
a typical response</a>.</p>

<p>I'm going to take a different approach.</p>
<p>I'm going to explore <strong>why</strong> computers work.</p>
<p>What's the difference?</p>
<p>Answers to "how?" questions tell us what method or steps make something happen.
In contrast, the answers to "why?" questions describe what makes something
possible ~ an opportunity to encounter a more fundamental perspective.</p>
<p>It's the difference between a car mechanic who may understand <em>how</em> an engine
works (so they can fix broken engines), and a mechanical engineer who
understands the physics and chemistry relating to <em>why</em> engines work (so they
can improve the design of engines). Knowing how something works means your
frame of reference is <em>within the system</em>, whereas if you understand why
something works you're not bound by existing products, solutions or cultural
practices.</p>
<p>Most importantly, cultivating an understanding of why something is possible is
an invitation for playful creativity, fearless exploration and careful
refinement of alternatives to the current crop of answers to "how?". It is an
opportunity to enlarge and change our world ~ a form of intellectual
empowerment and growth.</p>
<p>Knowing <em>how</em> is good, but understanding <em>why</em> is better.</p>
<p>With the scene suitably set, to start our journey, we'll learn all about...</p>
<h3>Following Rules</h3>
<p>Do you know how to play children's card game, Snap?</p>
<p>(Bear with me, I promise it'll be worth it.)</p>
<p>Using a standard deck of cards, the aim is to win all the cards by <em>taking
turns to play</em>.</p>
<p>Let's follow along as siblings Penelope (11), Sam (8) and Will (5) play a game:</p>
<p>Penelope (for no other reason than she's the oldest) acts as dealer. She
shuffles the deck of cards so they're in a random order and deals them, face
down and in equal quantity, to each player until there are none left to deal.
This is the starting state from which all games of Snap begin.</p>
<p>Sam, the player to the left of the dealer, takes the first turn.</p>
<p>Players take a turn by moving the top card from their face-down stack onto the
top of an adjacent stack of face-up cards, so the newly moved card is also
facing up. Since this is Sam's first turn, the face-up stack doesn't exist,
so a new stack is created with Sam's first face-up card taken from his pile of
face-down cards.</p>
<p>So ends Sam's turn.</p>
<figure><img src="images/snap.jpg" alt="A game of Snap!"><figcaption><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Snap" target="_blank">Source</a> - From

</figcaption></figure><p>The next player to the left, William, takes his turn in a similar fashion and
so the game continues from one player to the next.</p>
<p>After a while Sam shouts "SNAP". He's noticed that two face-up cards on top of
different stacks have the same value (for example, two aces are visible on top
of Penelope and Will's stacks). Since he was first to shout "SNAP" he wins all
the cards in the matching stacks of cards. He gleefully scoops up all the cards
in the face-up stacks belonging to Penelope and Will.</p>
<p>Play continues to the left of the player who turned up the matching card.</p>
<p>A few moments later Penelope shouts "SNAP". But there is a problem: there are
no matching face-up cards! William points this out to Penelope and reminds her
she has to pay a forfeit by giving one card to each of the other players from
her face-down stack. Sam and Will get a card each and Penelope is two cards
down.</p>
<p>At this point in the game Sam has the most cards. Will and Penelope have less
with only a few cards difference between the quantities in their face-down
stacks.</p>
<p>Things are hotting up and the three children become more excited: when two
matching face-up cards appear again all three of them shout "SNAP" at the same
time. Since nobody can claim to have shouted "SNAP" first, and to avoid
arguments, both the matching stacks are placed in the middle and added to the
"Snap pool". When "SNAP" is next called unambiguously and correctly, the winner
will get both the matching stacks and any cards in the "Snap pool". The stakes
have suddenly got higher.</p>
<p>Things quieten down for a few rounds until Penelope runs out of face-down cards
to put onto her face-up stack. At this point she simply flips over her face-up
stack and it becomes her face-down stack. Play continues as before.</p>
<p>Eventually, after a few more calls of "SNAP", Penelope finds that she's run out
of cards and so out of the game.</p>
<p>Sam and Will play together until, through luck and fast reactions, Sam finds
himself with all the cards and he's declared the winner of the game.</p>
<p>That's how you play Snap..!</p>
<p id="rules_of_snap">The rules illustrated in this deliberately precise story describe
<em>how</em>, given certain states of affairs, such-and-such things must
happen. States of affairs unambiguously describe how things are in the world.
For example, "there are two stacks of face-up cards whose top cards are of
matching value". When I describe how such-and-such must happen, I mean clear
and unambiguous instructions describe <em>how</em> play proceeds given a
certain state of affairs.</p>

<p>Put simply, this is <em>how</em> the game of Snap is played.</p>
<p>But <em>why</em> is Snap played?</p>
<p>Because, in addition to knowing the rules, we understand that playing the game
of Snap means modifying one's behaviour to follow these rules. If everyone
modifies their behaviour in accordance with the rules then folks can play
together. Obviously, we don't explain card games in such a formal manner to
very young children. But, as my description shows, children discover it's lots
of fun to informally learn and skilfully follow rules that bring about
exciting situations in games.</p>
<p>Knowing how to play Snap is analogous to knowing how computers work. Looking
beyond the rules of Snap to appreciate that human behaviour and enjoyment
motivates people to follow the rules of the game, shows us <em>why</em> Snap is
played. This insight may also inspire us to invent new games. Perhaps we become
inspired to explore further aspects of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment" target="_blank">human behaviour relating to following rules</a>,
or we may even
<a href="https://theoryoffun.com/" target="_blank">reflect upon the nature of play or games</a>.
In any case, exploring <em>why</em> rather than <em>how</em> provides a
fascinating perspective from outside the system (of Snap, in this case).</p>

<p>We need to achieve an analogous enlargement of perspective beyond <em>how</em>
computers work in order to understand <em>why</em> computers work. Only by acquiring a
perspective outside current norms can we possibly hope to invent or improve
technology and explore the nature and use of such devices. The alternative is
churn and recycling of existing ideas within the current system ~ a situation
that stifles innovation or positive change.</p>
<p>The computing-related rules and states of affairs I'm going to describe are not
much more complicated than the game of Snap explained above. However, what
follows may include a few <em>brain twists</em> where I expect you to use your
imagination to see things in a seemingly unusual or unintuitive way! I'm
challenging you to acquire a new perspective about seemingly everyday things.
The external world remains as it was before, but you will have changed. Your
newly acquired perspective reveals a deeper understanding of what you're
observing and why this makes computing possible. It's fun and can result in
rather pleasant "aha" moments (if you were a cartoon character, it's that
feeling you get when a lightbulb appears above your head).</p>
<p>The next chapter in our story is a beautiful brain twist: to think about
thinking...</p>

<p>(Some raw thoughts I've written down solely to help me clarify my thinking.)</p>
<p>Being together with people I love and who love me in return is a source of
great joy and solace.</p>
<p>Yet being with people can also lead to distress.</p>
<p>Like many, I've encountered rejection and resulting feelings of loneliness,
I've been the target of ignorant nastiness, and some make it clear I am of no
value while others happily place unreasonable burdens upon me. My own
experiences are but a small selection from the menu of unwelcome situations
that could be, and often are, meted out to people.</p>
<p>Dealing with complicated experiences and finding a way to work through
challenging encounters often feels painful and can lead to a sense of failure
or hopelessness. But I believe this process is also an opportunity for growth,
albeit through small, difficult, and often misplaced, steps. Allowing
complicated feelings, pain and failure to manifest is certainly better than the
alternative: sweeping things out of sight means the distress is never
addressed, explored or dealt with.</p>
<p>So, being together requires conscious work and reflection.</p>
<p>The good stuff can take as much effort as the bad. To be loving, compassionate,
tolerant and forgiving towards others requires great strength of character. The
bad stuff shows we are all flawed sensitive beings whose strength often fails
us. We have an endless capacity to hurt and be hurt by each other. This is
especially true if we don't allow ourselves the time and energy to reflect upon
and consciously adjust our behaviour towards each other.</p>
<p>Sadly, some simply don't care for others or for such self reflection.</p>
<p>For example, narcissists (by definition) lack empathy or compassion and only
make an effort in relationships if they see a benefit to themselves. This is a
tragic form of ignorance, for they will never know the joy of relationships
shared with loved ones who reciprocate emotional investment and mutual care.
For them, being together is an exercise in self aggrandisement, domination or
profit.</p>
<p>The origins of such self-centredness are complicated. Ironically, introspection
and self-reflection - the very traits such people fail to exercise - would help
address and overcome such origins.</p>
<p>I believe everyone has a unique and valuable journey through life, even if
their current location or direction of travel is deeply problematic.
Recognising this applies to a narcissist or other difficult individual takes
(the afore mentioned) strength of character. But it means it is possible to be
together without getting crushed by the weight of their ego or toxic behaviour.
Sadly, sometimes this is simply not possible and you have to cut your losses
and move on.</p>
<p>I often wonder how to respond to the difficulties that arise from being
together with others. I continue to believe that being together is often a
privilege and a source of happiness and growth. Yet some of my recent
collaborations have also been a source of great pain (interactions with aspects
of the Python community
<a href="https://ntoll.org/article/compassion/">spring to mind</a>). As a result, my
feelings about being together have changed significantly over the past
couple of years. </p>
<p>I used to be all about promoting "the community" as a way of being together.
An immediate problem is "the community" is an amorphous blob of a term that
folks never pin down. This is a significant cause of many problems as
misunderstanding is rife. In any case, I naively contributed and volunteered my
code, time, effort and money. In short, I tried very hard to be a positive part
of "something". For the past 12 years or so, this "something" was the Python
programming community.</p>
<p>In my experience, there are two common contrasting ways folks describe or
think about the notion of "community": top-down (meaning the community is
managed) and bottom-up (where the community emerges through participation). </p>
<p>I've always been reticent about top-down bureaucratic, formal and
hierarchical notions of community. Often they are well meaning yet ineffectual
(or sometimes even damaging) self defeating processes. They can also easily
turn into toxic dumpster fires full of malice (politics and power plays being
well known examples of contributing factors to such a sorry state of affairs).
Finally, they tend to gain a momentum that makes it easy to squash and ignore
rather than cherish and nourish individuals and creative innovation. While
my experience of the "formal" Python community has mostly been extraordinarily
positive, there has been enough not-so-good-stuff that I've chosen to step
away. I can only but wish the Python community well, but it's a ship in which I
no longer sail.</p>
<p>But I don't want to find myself in a chaotic bottom-up community either.
While these are ad hoc, improvised and informal, there is still a hierarchy,
along with impositions of power and other negative political machinations.
These are lived out through hidden communication channels, gossip or because
the loudest or most charismatic folks hold the floor. People are either "in"
or "out" of the circle of these "movers and shakers".</p>
<p>At least more formal communities appear to be up front about hierarchy, the
exercise of power, the scope and relations of roles and how one assumes
positions therein..!</p>
<p>I can't help but feel that something is missing when we view communities as
such formal structures. Communities are collections of individual people and,
perhaps, the missing element to make sense of being together is an explicit
focus on the "character" of participants. Just how do individuals reflect and
choose to behave when being together?</p>
<p>I'm reminded of <a href="https://www.lewissociety.org/innerring/">this rather interesting essay</a>,
by C.S.Lewis. I first read it when I was a music undergraduate and found it via
my Christian room-mate. Lewis describes an "Inner Ring", something akin to the
circle of "movers and shakers" vying for influence, power and prestige that I
describe above. The part of the essay that most speaks to me comes at the very
end:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And if in your spare time you consort simply with the people you like, you
will again find that you have come unawares to a real inside: that you are
indeed snug and safe at the centre of something which, seen from without,
would look exactly like an Inner Ring. But the difference is that the secrecy
is accidental, and its exclusiveness a by-product, and no one was led thither
by the lure of the esoteric: for it is only four or five people who like one
another meeting to do things that they like. This is friendship. Aristotle
placed it among the virtues. It causes perhaps half of all the happiness in
the world, and no Inner Ring can ever have it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reaching back in time to feel like my 18 year old undergraduate self, I want to
be with folks who are open to compassionate, collaborative, cooperative
ways of working but without any extra problematic notions of "community" (as
described above). I simply want to bring myself, and welcome others who want to
join me, in a place where there's recognition, a connection, frisson or
creative energy from which we can mutually grow.</p>
<p>In other words, I am inviting friendship.</p>
<p>Friendship requires trust, honesty, tolerance, compassion and forgiveness...
all those things that depend upon strength of character. Putting in such effort
for others is the antipode of the machinations needed to become one of the "in"
crowd or a member of the organisational elite.</p>
<p>So here's the thing... the tech world has its fair share of folks who forget or
don't understand what I believe makes a place positive, friendly and safe when
being with each other. Such folks see collaboration in terms of gaining
prestige and power. This is the stuff of narcissistic day dreams.</p>
<p>In an organised community such behaviour is addressed by a code of conduct (and
the Python community spend a lot of time and energy acting on this with varying
degrees of success, from [alas] hollow virtue signalling through to very
effective networks of support centred on extraordinarily kind and caring
individuals). Conversely, informal communities tend to lack this sort of
public or explicit "framework" often with detrimental results (folks are able
to capitalize, abuse or manipulate the informal "hidden" networks and
relationships to selfish or unpleasant ends with no clear way to call them
out).</p>
<p>My focus on self-reflection and things within my own control explains why I've
found myself writing a sort of poetic personal code I call
"<a href="https://github.com/ntoll/being_together">on being together</a>".
I'll make it a part of all my future coding projects (and encountering
<a href="https://github.com/Xe/creators-code">Xe's Creator's Code</a>
inspired this effort). It's very much a work in progress and has become an
expression of what you can expect from me and what I hope from you should we
find ourselves "being together" in a place to collaborate with each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<br>
When being together, especially if things go wrong,<br>
we acknowledge and work through differences.<br>
In so doing, we transform and enlarge each other.<br><br>
To nurture our mutual growth,<br><br>
    this is a place of<br>
        learning, understanding, and sharing;<br><br>
    this is a place to<br>
        affirm tolerance and compassion;<br><br>
    this is a place for<br>
        collaborative creativity.<br><br>
All the aspects of yourself you choose to bring to this place<br>
are welcome here.<br><br>
Reciprocate! Welcome, embrace and learn from others<br>
(even in the face of apparent hostility or misunderstanding).<br><br>
To act against this spirit invites ostracism,<br>
a loss that diminishes us all.<br><br>
Thank you.<br><br>

<p><a href="https://ep2020.europython.eu/">EuroPython</a> took place last month and the
raw video footage of the talks has just been published online. EuroPython has
always been one of my favourite conferences and is a special place for me:
it's where I gave my first ever programming talk back in 2010. It's also one of
the most culturally cosmopolitan coding conferences and was the world's
first community organised Python software conference. I always come away
feeling enriched by EuroPython.</p>
<p>Thanks, as always, to the volunteer organisers who work so hard to bring about
this remarkable event. Such thanks are especially well deserved in 2020 since
it was held online due to the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The potential for
technical mishaps and problems was huge, yet the friendly and supportive team
behind the conference ensured a slick and engaging event.</p>
<p>As always, there were many great talks with a particular highlight for me being
a fascinating explanation of building "artistic artefacts" (computer generated
pictures in the style of human painters) with
<a href="https://ep2020.europython.eu/talks/BSeL2FG-painting-with-gans-challenges-and-technicalities-of-neural-style-transfer/">Generative Adversarial Networks</a>.</p>
<p>However, I sorely missed the corridor track - when you walk around the physical
conference venue and bump into an old buddy, find yourself striking up a
conversation with a friendly co-attendee in the coffee queue, or join a huddle
of welcoming folks discussing something interesting. The corridor track is
where the community comes alive. I'll have more to say about this in a
moment...</p>
<p>I was delighted to make two contributions to this year's conference.</p>
<p>The first was a wonderful opportunity to bring some music to the conference. My
friend and EuroPython's own force of nature,
<a href="https://www.malemburg.com/marc-andre-lemburg">Marc-André</a> got in touch
to say that they were looking for musical contributions to a "jam session". I
have, on several occasions, inflicted my love of tubas on Marc-André so
he knew I used to be a professional classical musician. I can only assume his 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJZObBSU7E">Germanic inclination for oompah-bands</a>
was at the back of his mind when he reached out. I responded that tuba music is
"rather niche" at the best of times, let alone as part of a "jam session".
Nevertheless, I agreed to contribute something, "perhaps a piece of classical
piano music?" (since I'd been playing lots of piano during lock-down here in
the UK).</p>
<p>In the end, I went for some
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Brahms">Brahms</a> ~ an
<a href="https://www.mfiles.co.uk/scores/brahms-intermezzo-op118-no2.pdf">Intermezzo</a>
written "as a token of friendship" for his friend, the concert pianist and
composer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Schumann">Clara Schumann</a>. It's
my musical token of friendship towards everyone at EuroPython.</p>
<p>I hope you like it.</p>

</div>

<p>My second contribution was
<a href="https://ep2020.europython.eu/talks/AGaSaW8-how-to-run-a-corridor-track-in-a-remote-conference-with-python/">a presentation</a>.
The slides I prepared, including the links to all the resources I mention
<a href="static/presentations/textsmith_ep2020/index.html#/">can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>The presentation is an exploration of how one might recreate a remote corridor
track via the internet. I think it speaks for itself (honestly, go watch it, I
had a lot of fun preparing and presenting it).</p>

<p>The summary is that I feel deeply uncomfortable about the way friendships,
conversation and community are mediated in a technical context at this moment
in time. This is something we should be especially concerned about given how
much of our interactions have taken place online during these times of virus
related lock-down.</p>
<p>I offer a quick explanation of what I find so uncomfortable about the current
state of the art and look into the history of computing for other, more humane,
respectful (of users) and creative means of communication via computers.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I describe how I'm using Python to recreate a programmable
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUD</a> (a multi-user, real time text based
virtual world) based upon ideas first explored in the late 1970s and which I
encountered in both the 1980s (while at school) and in the mid-1990s (when I
was at university). Such creations were famous for their mazes of twisty
passages that players could explore and inhabit together.</p>
<p>If you've never heard of MUDs before, here's
<a href="https://mud.co.uk/richard/">Richard Bartle</a> (one of the authors of the
original MUD and author of the
<a href="https://mud.co.uk/dvw/">bible for virtual worlds</a>) describing an old
technology for talking directly to the imagination...  </p>

</div>

<p>As always, I love feedback, comments and constructive criticism offered in good
faith. Assuming the lock-downs have eased, next year's EuroPython will be in
Dublin, Éire.</p>
<p>I love Ireland. Can't wait!</p>
<p>See you at next year's EuroPython!</p>

<p>I've spent today updating everything to do with ntoll.org. Many
thanks to my buddy <a href="https://kushaldas.in/">Kushal Das</a> for the invaluable
advice on various technical matters.</p>
<p>Here's what I've done:</p>
<ol>
<li>The website is run using <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> ~ a Python based
   static site generator. It was <em>very</em> easy to migrate away from my previous
   hand-coded solution made with a custom
   <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/">Flask</a> script and HTML.</li>
<li>It's hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> which is both free
   and makes it very easy to manage code and deployment.</li>
<li>I've switched email hosting to <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a>, who 
   made the whole migration process extraordinarily easy. </li>
<li>I've archived the code for the old website for "safe keeping", even though
   all the content has moved over to the new site.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lots of things have changed in addition to my own technical infrastructure.</p>
<p>I've just finished a very busy period of freelance work with two clients -
the <a href="https://freedom.press/">Freedom of the Press Foundation</a> for whom I
contributed Python code to an
<a href="https://securedrop.org/">application for journalists</a>, and
<a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/">NHSDigital</a> for whom I fulfilled the remote role of a
code mentor / developer coach (like an agile coach, but much more technical).
I was collaborating with a team of Java developers who were learning Python and
Django while building APIs for internal customers and users. I also provided
Python training, which was very rewarding since I love teaching and the
NHSDigital folks were already technically very strong and lots of fun. Both
teams were exceptionally talented and friendly. I had a blast and made lots of
new friends.</p>
<p>In just over a week I'll be starting a new gig with the
<a href="https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/">Ministry of Justice</a> as a senior Python
engineer. I'm <em>really</em> looking forward to this since the work is useful,
interesting and challenging. I'm looking forward to learning from my new
colleagues and making contributions to our collective effort.</p>
<p>What does this mean for all my other projects (for instance
<a href="https://codegrades.com/">CodeGrades</a> or <a href="https://codewith.mu/">Mu</a>)..?
Ironically, I believe I'll have more rhythm to my day and so my work on these
projects will continue in my own time, but at a more predictable pace. Watch
this space. :-)</p>
<p>Finally, the current Corona virus pandemic is affecting life in rather
unforeseen ways: my daughter and older son have had their summer exams
cancelled. Apparently, their results will be based upon their predicted grades.
It means my daughter is going to read Mathematics at university with a
scholarship (dependent on her achieving her target grades, which she will in
light of the current situation) and my son will have the grades needed to go
onto study Physics, Maths, Music and Design Technology at "A" level (his
current plan is to read engineering at university). My youngest son continues
school lessons, completed at home via an online platform.</p>
<p>We've also had to purchase some home-studio equipment (mics, pre-amp, monitor
speakers, midi keyboard and related audio software). Mary, my wife, uses this
to teach her many instrumental students remotely via video calls. It soon
became apparent that laptop or mobile phone mics are not great for cello
or piano teaching. Happily, the new equipment is proving to be a great success
and Mary is able to continue teaching most students without disruption and from
the comfort of our own music room:</p>
<p><img alt="Our home studio" src="images/studio.jpg"></p>
<p>It also means <em>I</em> have the equipment available to produce my own (Python)
training materials and the kids are having a great time mixing all sorts of
different types of music.</p>
<p>Here's hoping you stay safe and remain healthy during this challenging time.
Since most of us are in lock-down, don't hesitate to get in touch if you fancy
a chat..! Social distancing rules don't mean you have to be anti-social.</p>
