<p>This is the first in a semi-regular series of posts about digital archaeology
relating to 1980s era 8-bit microcomputers. In a strange turn of events, not
only am I the archaeologist, but it is my own code that is to be uncovered and
interpreted.</p>

<p>The aim was to democratise computing. We didn’t want people to be controlled

<p>As a child, the first programming language I learned was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Wilson">Sophie Wilson's</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_BASIC">BBC Basic</a>, written for Acorn's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro">BBC Micro</a>. Without this formative
experience, I wouldn't have become a professional software engineer.</p>
<p>Most of my childhood was spent in the 1980s, and in 1982-ish the UK Government
ensured every school in the UK had a BBC micro.</p>

computer back home one holiday to figure out how to use it. It didn't take very
long to prize the device away from him, and so I started to explore the
"Welcome" software, loaded from a tape via a sequence of squeaks and growls
(representing the bytes to load into the computer's memory). Since I would have
only been eight at the time the
<a href="static/files/BBC_User_Guide.pdf">user guide</a> was beyond my understanding,
so a trip to the local library furnished me with a new book aimed at kids who
wanted to play games on their computers. The book in question was
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxv0SsvibDMTNlMwTi1PTlVxc2M/view?resourcekey=0-kaU6eyAmIVhT3_H8RkHfHA">Computer Spacegames</a> published by

<p>The first proper program I ever typed into the BBC can be found on page 5. It's
a sort of text based rocket pilot game... you have to take off before the
aliens get you:</p>

<p>I have a vivid memory of my aunt, uncle and cousins visiting at the
time. My cousin Michael (five years older than me) shared a fascination with
computers. As a teenager he was clearly at a more advanced level of
understanding, and it was from him that I got lots of tips, tricks and
encouragement to goof around.</p>
<p>So I did.</p>
<p>I changed line 160 to read:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nl">160</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">PRINT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"YOU ARE AN IDIOT"</span>
</pre>

<p>Then I persuaded my unsuspecting Uncle Colin to play.</p>
<p>Since he's an engineer I think he got the
impression there was some sort of simulated Newtonian mechanics going on and
took it quite seriously. Of course, if you read the code, it's just a glorified
guessing game. When he inevitably failed to take off, I remember he exclaimed
"how rude", muttered something about the computer being broken then wandered
off to escape any further computer-related space piloting catastrophes. But my
eight-year-old self was delighted. I spent the next ten minutes laughing
like a maniac at having hoodwinked an adult with my modified code.</p>
<p>Emboldened by this turn of events (and Michael's mischievous teenager-y
encouragement) I soon graduated to a new form of entertainment when dragged
shopping by my parents. I'd wander off on my own to find the computer
stands in retailers. Being a kid, I was mostly ignored as I typed code into
the demonstration machines.</p>
<p>Code like this:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nl">10</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">CLS</span>
<span class="nl">20</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">PRINT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"YOU ARE AN IDIOT"</span>
<span class="nl">30</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">GOTO</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nl">20</span>
</pre>

<p>I'd walk away (after typing <code>RUN</code>) and surreptitiously observe the next person
to encounter the demonstration machines... all telling them they were an idiot
ad infinitum. I soon realised the shop assistants could clear my
school-boy silliness by pressing the <code>ESCAPE</code> or <code>BREAK</code> keys. Yet I also
realised it was possible for the function of such keys to be modified: some of
the code ran on my school's BBC micro clearly made sure any accidental or
deliberate use of <code>ESCAPE</code> or <code>BREAK</code> didn't interfere with whatever
software the teacher had set up for us to use.</p>
<p>I had to wait for the next visit of my cousin Michael to learn how to "improve"
my code so it defeated shop assistants. To cut a long story short it's possible
to rebind the <code>ESCAPE</code> and <code>BREAK</code> keys to the extent that the only way to stop
the machine from doing what it's doing is to switch it off and on again. My
cousin pointed out that the answers to such problems could be found in the
(afore linked) user guide. In fact rebinding <code>BREAK</code> was explained on page 143
and disabling <code>ESCAPE</code> involved this magic incantation at the start of your
source code:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nl">10</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="vg">FX</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="il">200</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="il">3</span>
</pre>

<p>I was off!</p>
<p>Most importantly, I realised the user guide wasn't a boring manual for adults
but, if approached in the right way, it was the source of all sorts of useful
knowledge and information and I merely had to figure out how to find it. I was
also helped by yet-more-computer-books from Usborne and my local library, a
subscription to
<a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=acorn+user&amp;sin=&amp;and%5B%5D=mediatype%3A%22texts%22">Acorn User Magazine</a>
and various aspects of the BBC's magnificent
<a href="https://clp.bbcrewind.co.uk/">Computer Literacy Project</a>,
including TV programmes like this one:</p>

</div>

<p>You can <a href="https://clp.bbcrewind.co.uk/programmes">watch all the original 146 programmes online</a>.</p>
<p>But in the end I learned an important ethical lesson.</p>
<p>After leaving my unstoppable and mildly
insulting code running on a BBC micro at the Mansfield branch of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHSmith">WHSmith</a>, I was horrified to see one of
the retail assistants reprimanded by their supervisor. My joke wasn't funny and
I realised my code had consequences for others. A lesson that stays with me
to this day.</p>
<p>I also learned that revealing technical skill and knowledge can be tricky and,
at times, intimidating to others.</p>
<p>I remember getting a severe telling-off after I tried to help one of my
parent's teaching colleagues, the subject matter specialist for computing. I
was still at Primary school (probably around ten years old) and the ensuing
conversation, in front of my class mates, revealed the teacher's ignorance of
some aspect of how the BBC micro created sounds.</p>
<p>The conversation went something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TEACHER: "You can only make sounds like <em>this</em>."<br>
ME: "But Mrs.S, it's easier to make sounds like <strong>that</strong>."<br>
TEACHER: "You're wrong Nicholas. That simply won't work."<br>
ME: "Oh yes it will."<br>
(I demonstrate the damn thing working.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my enthusiasm to share a cool hack, I undermined the teacher and paid the
price with a bollocking.</p>
<p>To be clear, I wasn't rude. But I was certainly a confident enough ten-year-old
to know I had an easier way to make things work, while being naive to think
this would be welcomed. To be fair, I don't think they did themselves any
favours by telling me it simply wouldn't work. A more open minded teacher would
have said something like, "OK Nicholas, show me your way and let's compare
notes", and used the situation as an opportunity for learning. Yet, as a former
teacher myself, I know that it's often impossible to go off piste in a tightly
structured or time constrained lesson.</p>
<p>Such reminiscences are a prelude to the real digital archaeology.</p>
<p>Last year I found my old BBC micro, and a box full of floppy disks, in my
parent's loft. With their permission I took my finds to the UK's
<a href="https://www.tnmoc.org/">National Museum of Computing</a> (based at Bletchley Park
~ a mere 15 minute drive from where I live). I'll describe the details in a
follow-up post, but with the generous help of others, I was able to extract the
content of the disks.</p>
<p>By way of preview, embedded below is a BBC emulator running a sort of
"greatest hits" compilation of programmed musical performances. I put together
the disk
from various sources floating around my friendship group, and included some of
my own code too. The disk's menu system is of my own creation but based upon
two other fragments of code I found in a magazine: one for driving a disk menu,
the other for using arrow keys for selecting items. I'm also responsible for
the rather awful renditions of "The Swan" and "The Road Goes Ever On" (a
musical setting of some of J.R.R.Tolkien's poetry from the Lord of the Rings,
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Swann">Donald Swann</a>). If I remember
correctly, I was thirteen years old (in year 9, 1987) when I put this disk
together. As we'll see in future posts, it was a significant year for me in
terms of coding and music.</p>
<p>Click on the red LEDs at the bottom-left (so the embedded emulator has
keyboard focus), then use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to navigate
the menu. Click anywhere else on the main part of the page to remove keyboard
focus. Keys like <code>RETURN</code> (to make a selection) and <code>ESCAPE</code> (to stop a piece
and return to the menu) will behave as usual. However, I'm sorry to report I
used the <code>*FX 200,3</code> trick with "The Swan" ~ you're just going to have to sit
through that monstrosity in its entirety without the use of the <code>ESCAPE</code> key.</p>
<p>"You're welcome", says my thirteen year old self. ;-)</p>

</div>

<p>This is but a small example of some of the fascinating things I've found.</p>
<p>In future posts I'll reveal more about my programming, dive a little
into the technology I was using and try to place it all into the context of
my life at the time. As some of you already know, I'm actually a classically
trained musician, and this has some bearing on what I've managed to find... or
more accurately, what I've managed to find has some bearing on why I'm a
classically trained musician, who works as a software engineer with a passion
for computing education.</p>
<p>Finally, it turns out that the BBC micro didn't
<a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/the-legacy-of-bbc-micro/">create a legacy of fond memories and technical skill just for me</a>.
There are many folks of my age who have similar stories to tell.</p>
<p>Happy new year! More soon...</p>

    <p>It was an extraordinary privilege to be one of the keynote speakers at this
year's <a href="https://gh.pycon.org/">PyCon Ghana</a>. I was also very lucky to have the
support of my employer (<a href="https://anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a>) who covered the
costs associated with the trip for myself and my colleague,
<a href="https://cheuk.dev/">Cheuk</a>.</p>
<p>While this was my first trip to Ghana (actually, it was my first trip to
Africa), this was not my first Ghanaian interaction.</p>
<p>I can't begin to describe how important and nourishing the stimulating
interactions I've had with Ghana based friends Mannie and Michael have been.
Two years ago we were introduced by our mutual friend Conrad Ho, and since then
have met every month, in video calls, to discuss Python in education. The work
done by the Ghanaian Python community to engage in educational activities is
truly inspiring, and you can find out more
<a href="https://www.pythonghana.org/">here</a>.</p>
<p>That both Mannie and Michael are part of the PyCon Ghana organising team, and
this year's focus was on Python in education give a clue as to how I got
invited.</p>
<figure><img src="images/accra.jpg" alt="A view from our accommodation"><figcaption>The view of Accra from our accommodation.</figcaption></figure><p>After an eventful flight to Accra, both Cheuk and I went exploring during our
first full day. Adjacent to our accommodation was Oxford Street, containing
lots of shops, banks and other useful things we needed to visit. My immediate
impression was very positive... the Ghanaian folk we met were all friendly
and welcoming. "Good morning", "Hello", "Welcome to Ghana" and other such
greetings were common as we walked through the streets.</p>
<p>We also met the PyCon Ghana organisers at the venue. Having been involved with
community organising for well over a decade, I looked on in sympathy and (where
possible) got stuck in trying to help get everything set up. Like most aspects
of the Python community, PyCon Ghana is run by volunteers, and I'd like to
acknowledge their strength of character, friendliness and can-do attitude, led
by their chair, Francis. I saw first hand, that the Ghanaian Python community
is in good hands.</p>
<p>Sadly, I was ill on Thursday's tutorial day. My son had shared his cold with
me and it meant I had to stay home instead of attend Cheuk's amazing
<a href="https://humbledata.org/">humble data</a> workshop. But the enforced day of rest
meant I was ready for Friday and Saturday at the conference.</p>
<p>I was honoured to meet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nii_Quaynor">Nii Quaynor</a>
a Ghanaian gentleman who is often described as the father of the African
internet and an inductee to the <a href="https://www.internethalloffame.org/">Internet Hall of Fame</a>.
Nii eloquently spoke with considerable experience and authority of the
challenges and opportunities for working with governmental and international
agencies. I hope folks were paying attention since the Python community
in Ghana could be a significant contributor and collaborator in the technical
growth of the country.</p>
<p>There were also many other interesting talks, panels and workshops happening at
the event which made it feel like a typical Python conference found anywhere in
the world.</p>
<p>My first proper contribution to the conference was to run a two day workshop
on MicroPython on the micro:bit for young people. I have to say this was an
absolute joy and, assisted by Anthony and Joanna, we were also joined by
a collection of teachers, tech folk and IoT curious. The vibe was friendly and
the young people brought lots of energy and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Here's a video, shot on the second day while folks were building a project with
their micro:bit, to give a flavour of what went on.</p>

<p>Many thanks to the <a href="https://microbit.org/">MicroBit Foundation</a> for supporting
PyCon Ghana via the donation of 20 devices for participants to use and then
keep. Every device found a safe home, with many asking where they can be
obtained in Ghana..!</p>
<p>My keynote, on the subject of Python in Education, went well and as usual, I
especially enjoyed answering the questions at the end.</p>
<p>I was especially pleased to channel my "inner teacher" by (half jokingly)
setting the conference some homework.</p>
<p>I pointed out that somewhere will become known as a place of African technical
innovation. Somewhere will be lauded as having the most accessible and
creative coding education programme in Africa. Somewhere will famously
contribute a uniquely African story to our global technical community.</p>
<p>I asked, "why not you..?".</p>
<p>My homework task to the audience was to discover and become their own unique,
colourful and extraordinary community. They already have a small but strong,
vibrant and close knit nucleus from which to grow.</p>
<p>I hope, in ten years time,
to visit Ghana again and have some of today's community say to me, "see what
we did, and look where we're going...", and for me to be amazed.</p>
<figure><img src="images/ghana.jpg" alt="Ghanaian friends."><figcaption>Ghanaian friends.</figcaption></figure><p>Another aspect of the conference was its friendliness.</p>
<p>During the breaks I
spoke to many different people, from all over Africa, and drew energy from
their passion, enthusiasm and openness.</p>
<p>I also enjoyed the warmth of their
conversation and willingness to share games with me... I especially appreciated
learning how to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oware">Oware</a> from PyCon
Ghana organiser, Hillary. I enjoyed it so much I managed to buy a board in a
market in Accra and have taught my kids and wife how to play..! It's a big hit
in our house.</p>
<figure><img src="images/accra_beach.jpg" alt="The amazing view of a beach from the old presidential residence."><figcaption>The amazing view of a beach from the old presidential residence.</figcaption></figure><p>On my final day, the day after the conference, we hung out with the conference
organisers and visited tourist sites in Accra. It was wonderful to see
non-Pythonic aspects of Ghana... its cultural spaces, historic monuments, the
university and glimpse some of its natural beauty.</p>
<p>Through the course of my stay, I saw the twi word "akwaaba" in many places.</p>
<p>When I asked what it meant I was told it was a sort of very hospitable form of
"welcome".</p>
<p>"Akwaaba" is a pretty good word to describe my experience of PyCon Ghana.</p>
<p>Long may the Ghanaian Python community flourish and I look forward to 2032. ;-)</p>

<p>As I've <a href="article/pastures-new/">mentioned elsewhere</a>, I've just started a new
role at <a href="https://anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a>.</p>
<p>A week after joining I was asked to contribute an article to an internal
newsletter called "Consider This!". The format is simple: write something
thoughtful on a subject of interest to folks within the company, and, at the
end, curate a list of questions to prompt further thought and reflection.</p>
<p>I was invited to explore what I considered important aspects of great code
reviews. Thanks to Anaconda, the article is reproduced below. Additional thanks
to my colleagues Elise and Dan who provided invaluable and stimulating feedback
to significantly improve my first draft.</p>
<hr class="section_break">
<p>Ask a room of engineers what makes a great code review, and you’ll have as many
different opinions as there are engineers. Yet, in my experience, common themes
and archetypes emerge from the gloriously colourful and diverse descriptions of
a great code review. This article aims to explore what they might be.</p>
<p>At its core, a code review is exactly what it says: asking another to review
code.</p>
<p>Why might one do this? Often the simple answer is, “because I have to”.</p>
<p>Code hosting sites, like GitHub, make it easy for code reviews to be part of
the development process through concepts like pull requests (PRs for short).
Simply make a change to the code, bundle your changes into a PR, submit it and
wait for feedback from maintainers or colleagues. Sometimes you have to submit
code for review because of corporate governance, your employer or the open
source project to which you’re contributing may have an existing review process
for all contributions. Or it may simply be habit or herd instinct to follow
so-called “best practices”... folks do code reviews because everyone else does
code reviews and so they’re living up to expectations.</p>
<p>A code review could be an assessment to overcome, where someone in authority
accepts or rejects your changes. It might involve checking your changes to
ensure you’ve followed stylistic and technical conventions for a project, like
a teacher correcting work with a red pen. Furthermore, opinions about the
approach taken, methodology used or even the intention behind the change might
be offered, like a critic describing a restaurant, film or concert.</p>
<p>But there’s another, more engaging reason to participate in code reviews: if
done well, your world as a coder is enlarged by the process, be that as a
reviewer or contributor. In so doing, engagement with the project is a process
of growth, and the quality of the codebase is improved to reflect the shared
goals, ideas and aesthetic of those bringing the project into the world.</p>
<p>If a code review is used as a means of exercising authority then it’s no better
than pandering to another’s ego. Many projects have stylistic and technical
conventions, and checking such things can be easily automated so contributors
are confident their changes meet such minimum requirements before ever
submitting their code for review. Finally, if a critique of the approach,
methodology or intent is offered as part of a code review, then it’s happening
too late; such things should be discussed before code is submitted for
inclusion in the project, perhaps in early drafts (so called “code spikes”) or
exploratory proofs-of-concept.</p>
<p>From the contributor’s point of view, a code review is an opportunity to share
their work so others understand and see what they are offering. In other words,
a code review is an exercise in education as others encounter and explore new
aspects of the code base. From a reviewer’s point of view, a code review is an
opportunity to explore, internalise and offer constructive feedback of
another’s contribution. Once again, it’s an exercise in education as the
contributor is invited to explore their own work through the fresh eyes and
constructive commentary of the reviewer.</p>
<p>Earlier, I deliberately used the word “enlarge” when I said a code review
enlarges the world of those who participate. Enlargement is not synonymous with
“fun”, “positive” or “easy”. The process of enlarging one’s view of the code
might feel uncomfortable (perhaps you’re trying to get your head around a
difficult or unfamiliar concept), negative (you feel frustrated with yet
another bug in a hard-to-fathom part of the project) or difficult (the task at
hand is complex and requires much effort simply to engage effectively).</p>
<p>Yet, enlargement implies growth, understanding and progress, and I’m reminded
of the types of fun mountaineers use to categorise climbs.</p>
<p>A climb that is <em>type one fun</em> is fun because it’s fun to do, <em>type two fun</em>
is not fun at the time but fun to recollect afterwards because of the
achievement gained or lesson learned, and <em>type three fun</em> is not fun at the
time, nor fun to recollect because you realise you never want to be in that
situation ever again. Given a receptive spirit of learning, a mountaineer’s
view of the world is enlarged through a mixture of both <em>positive and
affirmative</em>, as well as <em>negative and difficult</em>, experiences.</p>
<p>So, how do we foster a spirit of enlargement in code reviews?</p>
<p>I believe mutual respect is key. Respect involves showing empathy, gratitude
and acknowledgement that, when difficulties arise, folks involved are acting
with the best of intentions. Another key factor is trust, an attribute of a
team that only comes through working together over time, making mistakes
together, and seeing evidence that folks support each other. I’d add that
compassion (an awareness of and sympathy for another’s feelings and situation,
mixed with a proactive desire to engage) is a great way to show support. When
things inevitably become difficult, then compassion for each other is a way to
embody mutual respect and build trust.</p>
<p>In the context of code reviews, such attributes help our judgement to become
deeper, more refined and aware of the wider context of the project and its
participants. A code review is no longer just an arbitrary measurement of
“quality” (have you followed our code conventions?), but becomes an exercise
in mutual learning and improvement that encompasses both enjoyable and
challenging aspects of participating in a coding project. At the heart of this
process is a strangely humorous paradox, as demonstrated by this old joke:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>STUDENT: O Guru, what is the secret of success?<br>
GURU: Good judgement.<br>
STUDENT: How do you get good judgement?<br>
GURU: Experience.<br>
STUDENT: How do you get experience?<br>
GURU: Bad judgement!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only when folks feel safe to exercise potentially bad judgement (through the
code they offer or the feedback they give), will they be able to gain
experience and learn good judgement. The code review is a place to pay
attention to each other’s contributions to facilitate mutual learning and
growth. This will, ultimately, improve the project as a whole, and help its
participants better engage with the tasks at hand.</p>
<p>“But”, I hear you ask, “what things should one do in a code review?”</p>
<p>If you’re expecting a “top ten interventions to make in a code review” type
post, you’re in the wrong place. In fact, such naive shopping lists
demonstrate a rather transactional and limited view of the process of a code
review, while completely missing the point I’m trying to make. I hope you
focus on embodying and passing on the sort of attributes that make a project
an enlarging place in which to contribute: mutual respect, trust and
compassion.</p>
<p>Perhaps we could learn by examining what other disciplines do when something
is offered and feedback is given. For example, such a process is at the heart
of musicians rehearsing (no matter the genre of music).</p>
<p>This short fragment shows Leonard Bernstein rehearsing an orchestra. Clearly
the triangle players are not playing to the high standard he expects.</p>
<div class="video-container">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ebf6_7nHciw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>I want to draw your attention to the relationship between the musicians
involved. How do Bernstein and the percussionists appear to you?</p>
<p>Folks might think Bernstein is condescending, sarcastic and not particularly
supportive. Others might see him as setting clear (and very high) expectations
through humour. Others might focus on Bernstein’s clear ignorance of triangle
playing and the resulting laughter from the percussionists. That we see the
same thing in different ways is itself an interesting and important outcome of
our diverse and multifaceted backgrounds (and it’s important to acknowledge and
recognise such differences).</p>
<p>The important relationship, upon which I want us to focus, is that between
Bernstein and the musicians. Only when there's mutual respect, a feeling of
safety and trust can such potentially difficult conversations, involving the
giving and receiving of constructive criticism to fulfil some important end,
take place. How such discussions unfold will reflect the unique relationship
cultivated between the participants. So long as both parties share a bond of
trust and respect, and we recognise and respect such a bond <em>reflects their
unique relationship with each other</em>, then we can engage with and learn from
the feedback and what the outcome tells us about the endeavour. In other words,
our world is enlarged by observing their interactions.</p>
<p>Questions to Explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>How has your world been enlarged through a recent code review?</li>
<li>Remember a time when you received valuable feedback or an important lesson
  that enlarged your world; how was it revealed to you?</li>
<li>What is your team’s approach to code reviews?</li>
<li>How do you and your collaborators cultivate a place of mutual respect, trust,
  and compassion?</li>
<li>Put yourself in Bernstein’s shoes, what would you say to the percussionists?</li>
<li>Imagine you’re the percussionists, how would you respond to Bernstein’s
  feedback?</li>
<li>Think of a recent PR submitted for you to review. How did you help enlarge
  the world of the author? How was your world enlarged?</li>

    <p>I had a wonderful time at <a href="https://ep2022.europython.eu/">EuroPython</a>, last
week, in Dublin.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of the conference, for me personally, involved giving
my talk entitled "Music and Code". It was an opportunity for me to reveal and
explore how I feel about programming, teaching and learning and the place of
tech in our wider culture. I've wanted to give a talk like this for over ten
years, but only recently have I figured out how to express what I wanted to say
through music as a metaphor.</p>

</div>

<p>Another important aspect of the conference was friendship and it was a huge
pleasure to be a small part of the organising team.</p>
<p>I especially
want to highlight collaborating with <a href="https://blog.europython.eu/humans-of-europython-vicky/">Vicky</a>
(a remarkable friend who embodies so many of the wonderful aspects of our
Python community: a pro-active "can do" attitude, an inclusive and
compassionate outlook towards others, and a formidable determination to
thoughtfully do "the right thing" for the benefit of the whole community). The
two of us flapped and faffed to fulfil a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture">Maker</a> space within EuroPython.
Given the amount of positive engagement from attendees, I hope this becomes a
regular feature of the conference. A case in point being the DIY robots
competing to solve a maze in the fastest time, organised by the energetic and
enthusiastic folks at the <a href="http://niraspberryjam.com/">Northern Ireland Jam</a>:</p>
<div class="video-container">

</div>

<p>I also want to mention <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/boyang-dou/">Raquel</a>, who
chaired this year's EuroPython. Her clear leadership, <em>from the front</em>, her
apparently infinite energy, <em>displayed through her considerable efforts</em>, and
her humane connection with folks, <em>embodied by her patience, friendliness and
compassion</em> are generous gifts she has shared with us all. I sincerely hope
she's taking some post-conference time off, and I want to thank her for
reaching out to me, all those months ago, to become a part of organising
EuroPython. And I have to say all my fellow organisers were an absolute joy to
work with. Their collective courtesy, hard work, enthusiasm and friendliness is
a very rare and special thing that I hope we can sustain, nourish and
cultivate.</p>
<p>One other group of friends deserves a mention - my fellow maintainers of
<a href="https://codewith.mu/">the Mu code editor</a>. It was a huge amount of fun for us
to be together in the same place for the first time ever. I was especially
delighted to meet <a href="https://github.com/xbecas">Vasco</a>, face to face, for the
first time.</p>
<p>The final part of EuroPython were two days of "code sprints", where open-source
collaborators work together on their projects, meet to discuss technical and
other aspects of our collective work, and welcome new collaborators and friends
to our efforts. We, the maintainers of Mu, had a wonderful time focusing on
Mu related things, and collaborating with new contributors who have made
welcome enhancements to Mu.</p>
<p>Here's a picture of all the Mu maintainers at EuroPython:</p>
<figure><img src="images/mu_maintainers.jpg" alt="The five core Mu maintainers" title="The five core Mu maintainers"><figcaption>The five core Mu maintainers:
<a href="https://github.com/tjguk">Tim</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tmontes">Tiago</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/carlosperate">Carlos</a>,
myself and
<a href="https://github.com/xbecas">Vasco</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, I heard many wonderful talks, enjoyed the conversations with many
friends old and new in the famous corridor track and took part in some really
stimulating workshops (with my amazing daughter, who was attending her first
PyCon as a proper attendee with an interest in data science - she especially
enjoyed both
<a href="https://djangogirls.org/en/dublin/">Django Girls</a> and
<a href="https://ep2022.europython.eu/humble-data">Humble Data</a>).</p>
<p>I love EuroPython's culturally cosmopolitan feeling, something that's hard to
recreate at a national PyCon. I love how folks keep coming back to EuroPython,
there are people who mean a lot to me, who I only ever see at this conference.
I also love EuroPython's peripatetic nature, as a community we are welcomed to
all sorts of fun places and have an opportunity to soak up the vibe of
different countries and cultures.</p>
<p>Long may it last, and I hope to see you at next year's EuroPython.</p>

    <p>I have been a freelance software engineer for almost 17 years. In that time, as
is usual for a freelancer, I have changed roles every 18 months to two years.
Often I took time off between gigs to work on personal projects, write, reflect
or learn something new. For instance, in 2008 I left my role as a senior .NET
developer for an investment bank in London to learn Python, then reset my
career as a junior Python coder three months later and never looked back.</p>
<p>I've relished my freedom and independence, and it has been a privilege to work
on a huge variety of projects for a diverse range of companies in many
different sectors. I have been enriched by my colleagues, made many wonderful
friends, and learned a huge amount from folks.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone.</p>
<p>Yet change is in the air... Since January I've been in discussions with
<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> and from today (the Northern Hemisphere's
summer solstice no less!), I'm delighted to reveal I'll be joining them as
a principal engineer. Long may the sun shine on this endeavour. 🌞</p>
<p>The <em>very</em> big change for me and my family is that I'm an employee rather than
freelancer.</p>
<p>A big factor in persuading me to step away from freelancing were the folks I
met in interviews and the company culture I encountered leading up to my offer
of employment.</p>
<p>Another important factor was the nature of the work I'll be doing. I can't go
into details, but I'm very excited to work with an exceptionally talented group
of folks, on something that I'll relish getting my teeth into. Importantly, it
is an opportunity for me to bring together and use skills from many different
aspects of my background.</p>
<p>Finally, Anaconda understand what motivates folks passionate about creative
coding: I'll still be active as an open source contributor and will continue to
develop projects such as <a href="https://codegrades.com/">CodeGrades</a> in my own time,
as has been the case so far.  </p>
<p>Here's to new adventures.</p>
