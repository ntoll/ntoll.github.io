    <p>Last week I visited <a href="https://home.cern/">CERN</a> with my youngest (16yo) son,
William.</p>
<figure><img src="images/i_heart_cern.jpg" alt="We love CERN"><figcaption>Myself (L), William (R) and a young friend (C).</figcaption></figure><p>Our road to CERN started in the summer at
<a href="https://ep2023.europython.eu/">EuroPython</a>.
Will volunteered at the conference registration desk and checked in
<a href="https://pelson.github.io/">Phil Elson</a>. Noticing Phil's conference badge
(indicating he worked at CERN), physics-mad Will started asking Phil all
sorts of questions.</p>
<p>Further physics conversations ensued between Will and (the ever patient) Phil
over the course of the conference. In the end Phil suggested we just come visit
CERN and Will could explore to his heart's content. Furthermore, since I had
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlgC-v8l_Sk">presented a talk about PyScript</a>
at the conference, Phil mentioned colleagues at CERN who'd be interested in
learning more about the project and who may possibly have uses for the work I'm
currently doing. A plan was hatched for a "dad and son" adventure to CERN so
Will could soak up the physics and I could present and meet with fellow coders.</p>
<p>Thank you to Phil, Jo and their children for putting us up during our visit to
CERN. Staying at chez Elson was, in itself, worth the trip. Both Will and I
had lots of fun with the Elson children, be that reading stories together or
helping with dressing up.</p>
<figure><img src="images/astronauts.jpg" alt="Young astronauts"><figcaption>Young astronauts!</figcaption></figure><p>The photograph of the "#IðŸ’™CERN" sign, at the beginning of this post, was taken
outside the brand new education centre on the day we arrived at CERN.</p>
<p>As a former teacher, and someone still passionate about engineering education
and pedagogy, this brand new facility was great fun to explore. The curators
have put together an excellent set of displays, videos and interactive props
along with a comprehensive timetable of lectures, classes and workshops.</p>
<p>This is how to engage folks with science, technology and engineering. Bravo!</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> worked at CERN
when he invented the World Wide Web (through which you are reading this blog
post). I was delighted to find a small display in the exhibition space
explaining his work and the origin story of the web, along with the computer
used to develop the very first web server.</p>
<figure><img src="images/nicholas_web.jpg" alt="With the world's first web server"><figcaption>With the world's first web server.</figcaption></figure><p>The next day started at 8am with a visit to the
<a href="https://atlas.cern/">ATLAS</a> detector. The CERN
facilities were off for maintenance and upgrades, so we were able to get
to places not normally open to visitors like us.</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider">Large Hadron Collider</a>
is the world's largest and most powerful particle collider. It is 27
kilometres in circumference and buried around 100 metres below the French
and Swiss countryside. Put very simply, its job is to smash protons together so
physicists can analyse the resulting subatomic particle "debris" and learn more
about the structure of the subatomic world and the laws governing it.</p>
<p>The collisions happen at several points in the LHC and it is at such points
that particle detectors, like ATLAS, are found.</p>
<figure><img src="images/lego_atlas.jpg" alt="Lego ATLAS"><figcaption>A Lego model of ATLAS. Check the autographs on the bricks at the front of the model.</figcaption></figure><p>This being the first visit of the day to CERN facilities, the journey to the
device left quite a theatrical impression. We had to don hard hats (making us
all look like the Lego mini-figures on the model in the reception area), watch
as our guide used a retina scanner to access the facility (very Hollywood), and
travel 100 meters below the surface in a lift. We emerged into a labyrinth of
tunnels adjacent to rooms containing racks of computers and other equipment
needed to run the experiment.</p>
<p>Finally we got to the cavern containing ATLAS.</p>
<figure><img src="images/atlas.jpg" alt="The ATLAS experiment"><figcaption>The 7000 tonne ATLAS detector.</figcaption></figure><p>Photos of ATLAS don't do it justice: it is so overwhelmingly HUGE that your
whole field of vision is filled with the device (it is seven stories tall).
Imagine constructing a large multi-story car park filled to the brim with
intricate electronics, in a ship-in-a-bottle manner but 100 metres underground.
What a feat of planning, engineering and construction!</p>
<figure><img src="images/will_atlas.jpg" alt="Will and ATLAS"><figcaption>Will and ATLAS.</figcaption></figure><p>ATLAS is made up of layers, each of which detects different sorts of subatomic
particles - hence the circular arrangement of equipment centred on the particle
beam.</p>
<p>Each collision creates terabytes of data, most of which is processed as close
to the device as possible and thrown away. Only those aspects of the data that
are of interest get to make it to the data centres on the surface and then to
a global network of computers crunching and analysing the results (the World
Wide Web was invented specifically so scientists could share such data).</p>
<figure><img src="images/will_has_questions.jpg" alt="Will has questions"><figcaption>Will has questions.</figcaption></figure><p>Once the mind boggling scale of the device had been processed, as well as its
extraordinary engineering explained, William took the opportunity to ask the
physicists on hand all the questions about all the things. I have to admit, I
had no idea what they were talking about... I am a classically trained musician
with a background in academic philosophy who earns a living as a software
engineer, and so their conversation was well beyond my level of subject
matter knowledge.</p>
<p>Here's the thing, not for the first time I observed folks recognise in Will a
fellow physics enthusiast. Then they would open up about their passion for
their work and scientific interests. This was a privilege and joy to behold,
and Will was in his element. He really appreciated their time and patience.</p>
<p>Between technical meetings in the morning and a presentation about PyScript in
the afternoon, we saw many other parts of the CERN facilities. The highlight
for me being a visit to <a href="https://cms.cern/">CMS</a>, another titanic machine and
feat of engineering 100 meters below the surface.</p>
<figure><img src="images/we_took_the_lift.jpg" alt="We took the lift"><figcaption>Looking down the service shaft. We took the lift again.</figcaption></figure><p>The CMS device is, like ATLAS, a sub-atomic particle detector but at the
antipode of the LHC to ATLAS.</p>
<p>As I understand it, CMS and ATLAS essentially do the same thing but were
designed by independent teams so the resulting devices differ in their
capabilities and the details of their engineering. They complement each other
because the results from one device check and confirm the results of the other,
thus giving scientists greater confidence in the data coming from the detected
collisions in each device.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a friendly rivalry between the two teams and I quipped to
our CMS guide, Benjamin, that it felt like CMS and ATLAS are to physicists 
as vi and EMACS are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">to computer programmers</a>.
To which Benjamin shot back, "I'm a vi user". This was yet another hint at the
renaissance man/woman aspects of many of the hugely talented folks working at
CERN. Through the course of our tour, not only did Benjamin reveal his
background in Physics (by fielding yet more questions from Will, of increasing
incomprehensibility to me) but touched upon the various engineering aspects of
the CMS device as well as sojourns into materials science, computing hardware
and "big data". Bravo Benjamin, this was an entertaining virtuoso performance
of passion for the project.</p>
<figure><img src="images/cms_unplugged.jpg" alt="The CMS experiment"><figcaption>The 14000 tonne CMS detector.</figcaption></figure><p>Once again, the scale of the device was overwhelming.</p>
<figure><img src="images/cms_build.jpg" alt="Building the CMS"><figcaption>A photo of a poster showing pieces of CMS being lowered into
position down the service shaft.</figcaption></figure><p>The service tunnels and shafts underground were perhaps more accessible to see
at CMS than at ATLAS, and these additional aspects of the life of the project
gave yet another dimension of the overwhelming scale of what goes on at CERN.
We were, in a sense, able to see the neck of the bottle through which the
14000 tonne CMS "ship" had been built.</p>
<figure><img src="images/will_cms.jpg" alt="Will and CMS"><figcaption>Will and CMS.</figcaption></figure><p>It is while in the presence of such devices that one ponders how such things
are maintained and improved, who designs them, and what resources are
needed to make things work. It is then that one realises that CERN isn't just
about science, it's also a sort of creative cultural experiment consisting of
a huge number of people spread all over the world, collaborating to help us
comprehend what the universe is and how the universe behaves.</p>
<figure><img src="images/cms.jpg" alt="Nicholas and Will with CMS"><figcaption>Will and I dwarfed by the staggering engineering of CMS.</figcaption></figure><p>However, such activity doesn't just happen at the titanic scale of ATLAS and
CMS.</p>
<p>The protons that are accelerated and smashed together have to come from
somewhere, and while visiting another CERN facility we found the source: a red
bottle containing hydrogen.</p>
<figure><img src="images/proton_source.jpg" alt="Proton source"><figcaption>Get yer fresh protons here! (From the red bottle of hydrogen.)</figcaption></figure><p>If that looks like a thermos flask containing a nice hot cup of tea
(<a href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Infinite_Improbability_Drive">hat tip</a>),
you're not wrong. Such mundane looking yet essential objects
were another aspect of CERN that reminded me that any large engineering effort
contains an abundance of seemingly boring yet rather important bits and bobs
randomly attached to other stuff.</p>
<p>Another aspect of any complicated engineering effort is the inevitable use
of hand written warnings hastily taped to a button, panel or (in the following
case) valve:</p>
<figure><img src="images/valve.jpg" alt="Valve must be closed"><figcaption>No matter the complexity of the engineering, you'll always find
a handwritten note.</figcaption></figure><p>In a similar vein, the LHC needs an "off" switch - a delightfully understated
device found on the desk of an operator in the LHC control room. This is used
when things don't go to plan.</p>
<figure><img src="images/lhc_off_switch.jpg" alt="LHC dump beam"><figcaption>The LHC's beam dump switch (basically, the "off" button).</figcaption></figure><p>When pressed the LHC isn't actually switched off... rather a dump of the beam
occurs, where the protons, travelling at near the speed of light, get
redirected in a spiral fashion to around 30 meters of material that act as
a cushion to absorb the beam (to spectacularly over-simplify what really goes
on).</p>
<p>CERN also has a sense of humour.</p>
<p>When I asked a guide what went on at a rather nondescript area on a schematic
map of CERN labelled "north facility", they replied, with a twinkle in their
eye, that it was where they manufactured all the black holes. Another scientist
pointed at a door and exclaimed with glee that it was where they keep all the
secret alien technology (but they'd have to kill me if they told me more).</p>
<p>Clearly such tomfoolery is a complete nightmare for CERN's PR and media
department.</p>
<p>Thanks to the World Wide Web, not only can theoretical physicists share
information, but conspiracy theorists can share their own unhinged,
one-sandwich-short-of-a-picnic misinformation about what the universe is and
how the universe behaves. This includes many
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_in_black">Men In Black</a>
style assertions about CERN ~ such as the possible manufacture of world-ending
black holes.</p>
<p>Rest assured, the most dodgy things I observed at CERN were an interesting
looking risotto in
<a href="https://sce-dep.web.cern.ch/catering/refurbishment/restaurant1">restaurant 1</a>,
a desire to number buildings in chronological order of construction (something
with which even
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postman_Pat">Postman Pat</a> would struggle), and a
large number of champaign bottles in the CERN control room (clearly these folks
know how to party).</p>
<figure><img src="images/bottles.jpg" alt="Bottles in the CERN control room"><figcaption>CERN operations know how to hold a good party.</figcaption></figure><p>Actually, if you look carefully at the bottles you'll notice that each is
labelled with the name of a successfully completed experiment. Apparently it is
traditional to send an appropriately decorated bottle of bubbly to the CERN
operations team as a token of thanks for their considerable expertise and work
running the LHC.</p>
<p>That there is a CERN operations team, whose job it is to "drive" the LHC for
everyone else, is a reminder that CERN is not just full of physicists.
There is so much complementary work going on. Remember, the reason I was at
CERN was to talk about PyScript: CERN makes use of, and are interested in, all
sorts of computing technology, a huge variety of engineering, and ever more
creative ways in which to explain and share what on earth is going on to the
rest of the world.</p>
<p>A wonderful example of such a complementary discipline at work at CERN was
demonstrated during our visit to the robotics facility.</p>
<figure><img src="images/will_with_robots.jpg" alt="Will with robots"><figcaption>Will with robots.</figcaption></figure><p>How do you service the LHC when it is functioning?</p>
<p>You don't send people down there!</p>
<p>Instead, you use robots!</p>
<p>This was our final visit at CERN, on the morning of our return home. What
should have been a 45 minute quick guided tour extended to about an hour and a
half of enthusiastic explanation and demonstration.</p>
<p>The robotics lab have mock-ups of all the different sorts of area at CERN in
which the robots work, so they are able to test them and rehearse "situations".
The robots range from
repurposed bomb disposal robots trundling around on tank tracks, to robots that
hang from the monorail attached to the ceiling of the tunnel in which the LHC
is housed.</p>
<figure><img src="images/robot_test_tunnel.jpg" alt="The robot testing tunnel"><figcaption>Phil, Jo, myself and Will in the robot testing tunnel.</figcaption></figure><p>It was fascinating to learn how the robotics team take off-the-shelf parts and
modify, adapt and re-purpose them with bespoke "stuff" to help them do their
maintenance work.</p>
<p>For example, we were shown an electric drill you could have purchased from any
conventional DIY store, that had been dismantled, reconfigured and reassembled
to work while connected to a robot arm in the sometimes limited space in which
such devices are needed.</p>
<p>How else are you going to unscrew nuts and bolts with a robot?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out you could use a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PNU84bbass">Luke Skywalker like</a>
robotic hand.</p>
<figure><img src="images/robot_hand.jpg" alt="A robot hand"><figcaption>Will demonstrating a robot hand for fine-grained "human"
controls.</figcaption></figure><p>When I enquired about its capabilities I was told it had many degrees of
movement in all the joints one finds in a human hand. I wondered out loud if
anyone had ever tried to play the piano with it, to which our host gave me
a raised eyebrow and a thoughtful, "hmmm... that would be interesting".</p>
<p>Of course, there are your common "service droid" type robots that trundle
around on wheels with a camera and arm attached to them. Even these are
intricate and substantial bits of kit.</p>
<figure><img src="images/droid.jpg" alt="A robot helper"><figcaption>A robot used for servicing when the LHC is on.</figcaption></figure><p>Both Will and I had a great time at CERN. A large part of the reason
being Phil, Jo and their family's hospitality. As we were leaving for the
airport Phil mentioned a film, called
<a href="http://particlefever.com/">Particle Fever</a>,
that tells the story of how the folks at CERN confirmed the existence of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson">Higgs boson</a>. On our return home
Will and I watched it... and if you're looking for a film about particle
physics, this is <em>NOT</em> it. Rather, it tells a great story and places CERN, and
the work done there, into context.</p>
<p>At one point in the film, a physicist gives a presentation about the LHC
(at a moment in time just prior to when it was first switched on) and
fields a question from the audience. They are asked, "but what value is the
work at CERN? (and by the way, I'm an economist)". The physicist giving the
presentation is brutally honest and admits that he has no idea and the damn
thing may not work.</p>
<p>This moment resonated with me.</p>
<p>It's not uncommon for folks to doubt the value of endeavours close to my heart
such as classical music or philosophy. So hearing a physicist asked such a
question made me think, "huh... so it happens to you folks too...".</p>
<p>I feel sad, disappointed and frustrated when I encounter people who can't
imagine a world where <em>economic value is <strong>not</strong> the only valuable outcome</em>.</p>
<p>We don't make music, ponder philosophy nor try to comprehend the universe
because such activities create economic value. We do them because they make
life worth living, enlarge our world and connect us to something beyond
ourselves. Any economic value is merely a welcome fortuitous side-effect. The
Nobel Prize winning physicist
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman">Richard Feynman</a> claimed that
he didn't do physics to change the world or discover some grand unifying theory
of everything,<em> but just for the pleasure of finding things out</em>.</p>
<p>Bravo CERN, it was a pleasure to find things out about the work you all do. I
sincerely hope to return soon (with Will - he'd never forgive me if I left
him at home).</p>

    </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>One of the stand-out collaborations of my career has been with my buddy
<a href="https://dpgeorge.net/">Damien George</a>. He's the creator of
<a href="https://micropython.org/">MicroPython</a> ~ a lean and efficient implementation
of the Python programming language optimised to run in constrained
environments. When Damien created MicroPython I think he imagined "constrained
environments" to mean microcontrollers - the small single chip computers
beloved of embedded systems engineers, Internet of Things enthusiasts and the
Maker community.</p>
<p>Little did he realise that MicroPython was an amazing fit for another computing
context: the browser.</p>
<p><img alt="MicroPython" src="images/MicroPython_Logo.jpg"></p>
<p>The browser is an interesting space in which to work because of its unique
combinations of constraints.</p>
<p>Firstly, everything needed to view a web page needs to be delivered over the
network. So, the smaller the asset to be delivered can be, the better.
MicroPython, when compressed for delivery to the browser is only around 170k in
size - smaller than most images you find on most websites.</p>
<p>Secondly, the browser is perhaps the world's most battle tested sand boxed
computing environment. By this I mean that web browsers encounter all sorts of
interesting, nefarious, ill-performing, badly written and otherwise shonky
code. Such code should be constrained into a virtual sandbox, so it can't do
any damage to the user's wider system. Because of the recent development of
<a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/">web assembly</a> (shortened to WASM ~ a sort of
virtual microprocessor working in the browser), code written in C can be
compiled to run in the browser. MicroPython is written in C and Damien and his
collaborators have worked together to create
<a href="https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/ports/webassembly">a port for web assembly</a>.</p>
<p>Third and finally, the browser makes available to the developer of websites a
JavaScript object called <code>globalThis</code>, through which all the other objects,
functions and data structures needed to
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">access the capabilities of the browser</a>
are made available. By constraining developers to a single means of interacting
with the browser, there is only one way to go about making things happen.
MicroPython compiled to WASM has access to the full capabilities of the
sandboxed browser thanks to some of Damien's recent work on a foreign function
interface (FFI) that interacts with the JavaScript based APIs and capabilities
defined by <code>globalThis</code>.</p>
<p>Given this context, what does MicroPython allow you to do?</p>
<p>From within MicroPython running in the browser, one simply imports the <code>js</code>
module (short for JavaScript). It's an object in MicroPython that acts as a
proxy for <code>globalThis</code> in the browser. It makes interacting with the browser
from MicroPython an absolute joy. It's worth pointing out that Damien's work is
based upon the <code>js</code> work done as part of the
<a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/">Pyodide project</a> (a version of the CPython
interpreter for the browser), so no matter the version of Python you use in the
browser, you access the browser's capabilities in exactly the same way.</p>
<p>But recently, there was a problem.</p>
<p>I was due to give a talk about <a href="https://pyscript.com/">PyScript</a> (a platform
for taking MicroPython and Pyodide and making them easy to use in the browser)
at <a href="https://europython.eu/">EuroPython</a> and I was putting together code
examples of ever increasing complexity to present as part of my talk. But I
kept hitting strange errors when using MicroPython. My colleague and
web-guru <a href="https://webreflection.medium.com/">Andrea</a> managed to isolate the
problem but had been unable to work out why it was happening. Put simply,
somewhere in MicroPython's FFI, at that point where JavaScript and MicroPython
were interacting, unwanted JavaScript objects were unexpectedly leaking into
the MicroPython world thus causing things to crash. Think of it as a JavaScript
shaped spanner in the MicroPython works.</p>
<p>This wasn't a good situation to find oneself in, a few days before presenting
at one of the Python world's largest and most prestigious conferences.</p>
<p>Damien and I decided to debug the problem, and we recorded ourselves doing so
because Andrea wasn't available at the time of our call. We figured that if he
could watch our debugging session, he might spot something we hadn't and
suggest a fix.</p>
<p>In any case, what followed was a lot of fun, and the video of the debugging
session is embedded below.</p>
<p>There are some things you need to know before you watch the video:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both Damien and I know JavaScript to a sufficient level to be
  "dangerous". We can get stuff done, but we're not guru level like Andrea.</li>
<li>Damien is an expert in C (the language used to implement MicroPython) and
  clearly knows his way around the MicroPython codebase including the FFI that
  kept crashing. I am familiar enough with C to be able to read it, but not
  very experienced at writing it, and I certainly don't know anything about the
  MicroPython internals, including the FFI.</li>
<li>We were using a collaboration technique called pair programming: where one
  developer (Damien) is the "pilot" with the other developer (me) acting as
  "co-pilot". As you'll see in the video, Damien was sharing his screen so I
  could see what he was looking at and he'd often describe things, processes or
  problems to me, only for me to confirm them, explain them back or ask
  questions as a way to help maintain focus. As the one most ignorant of the
  language and code-base, I was in a good position to play the beginner to
  Damien's expert, and ask for clarifications.</li>
<li>Our debugging involved taking very careful steps to investigate and change
  the code so the problem was (happily) eventually revealed, tested and fixed.
  As the Chinese proverb explains: when crossing a river, it's best to do so
  slowly and by feeling with one's toes.</li>
<li>Both of us were having a lot of fun in different ways. Damien was clearly
  fascinated by delving into the problem. I was enjoying Damien's virtuosic
  debugging performance, and found out some fun stuff as we went along.</li>
</ul>
<p>So grab your popcorn, and enjoy the show:</p>

    <p>In June I was contacted by a friend in the EuroPython community.</p>
<p>They were looking for articles about how to deal with rejection and what to do
when one's proposal for a conference talk wasn't accepted. Since they couldn't
find anything suitable, they asked ChatGPT for suggestions, and this is how it
responded:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/chat-gpt-not-accepted.png" title="Talk not accepted"></p>
<p>In an entirely predictable turn of events, <em>ChatGPT was wrong</em> (no such post
existed at that time), and so I puckishly proposed writing such a post. We
can't have ChatGPT telling lies can we?</p>
<p>This is it.</p>
<hr class="section_break">
<p>It is a rare privilege to find oneself in a community who genuinely cherish and
support the participation of all. Such company guarantees we encounter folk
who are different to ourselves: an opportunity to learn from each other's
contrasting backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. It's why <em>diversity is a
precondition for growth</em>: our worlds are mutually enlarged by our differences.</p>
<p>But this isn't an easy journey.</p>
<p>It takes compassion, empathy and thoughtfulness to nurture a safe space where
such encounters take place. Participants - through their actions, attitudes and
attention - embody and live the inclusive and open minded ethos necessary for
such a precious situation. This is a complex relationship
between the individual participant's personal outlook and the collective
<em>esprit de corps</em> that emerges from the aggregate contributions and
interactions of many different individuals.</p>
<p>Here's the challenge: it's not enough for a group to say they're inclusive,
open-minded and whatnot... that's just empty virtue signalling. Merely
"going through the motions" is an ignorant and insidious sort of cultural cargo
cult ~ <em>communication at the expense of community</em>. It happens far too often,
and normalizing such behaviour actively diminishes the possibility of a
genuinely inclusive and open-minded space.</p>
<p>Rather, such a community spirit springs
from the <em>quality of the interactions between individual participants</em>.
Sometimes such interactions are unavoidably painful: as when a proposed
contribution to a community event is rejected by the organisers.</p>
<p>Yet it is at these moments when embodiment by individuals, and the emergent
community spirit, are so important.</p>
<p>This equally applies both to organisers and participants.</p>
<p>If you are an organiser of a community event, and have a call for proposals but
limited space, then you will inevitably reject (and therefore exclude) some of
the proposed contributions. If you believe in a diverse and inclusive culture
then this process may feel deeply uncomfortable and paradoxical.</p>
<p>But this is the puzzle you face, and (I'm sorry to say) there's no right
answer.</p>
<p>Actually, the notion that there <em>is an answer</em> to such a situation is, I
believe, deeply flawed. Rather, <em>how you choose to conduct yourself, pay
attention to the situation and engage with the unfolding events</em> will reveal
your community's spirit. I hope you make a conscious personal decision to
choose compassion, empathy and thoughtfulness over going through the motions of
a performative brain dead cultural cargo cult.</p>
<p>Alternatively for participants, it can be deeply upsetting if your contribution
to an event has been rejected. All sorts of complicated feelings may come up
(although some may just shrug and move on). I want to reassure you that it is
natural and understandable to feel sad, disappointed or upset by such
rejection. Lean into such feelings and give them the time and space they
deserve. The worst thing you can do is ignore them.</p>
<p>Most importantly, pay attention to what happens next.</p>
<p>If the organisers of the event embody an inclusive and empowering community
spirit, their interactions with you will be affirmative, compassionate and
supportive. If you engage in good faith, such organisers will likely welcome
feedback or suggestions. But please remember they're human beings too and they
may respectfully disagree with you. This is what it is to be in a
diverse community - you'll meet folk with different outlooks to your own.</p>
<p>It's an opportunity to learn!</p>
<p>As an exercise in self-understanding and growth, you may want to
explore why your proposal was rejected (if this hasn't already been
explained). Such feedback is best received in a spirit of constructive
collaboration. You'll either discover how
to improve your next proposal or come to see how the event in question isn't a
good fit for what you want to contribute.</p>
<p>If the former, reflect and refine for next time.</p>
<p>If the latter, your niche might be elsewhere, so keep exploring!</p>
<p>If the event organisers are simply going through the motions, you'll know to
avoid the event in future.</p>
<p>In any case, be you an organiser of or participant in community events,
best of luck. Just remember flouishing and fulfilling communities are all about the quality
of individual interactions, something over which you have direct control: <em>how
<strong>you</strong> choose to participate</em>.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>

    <p>This is the first in a semi-regular series of posts about digital archaeology

experience, I wouldn't have become a professional software engineer.</p>
<p>Most of my childhood was spent in the 1980s, and in 1982-ish the UK Government
ensured every school in the UK had a BBC micro.</p>

computer back home one holiday to figure out how to use it. It didn't take very
long to prize the device away from him, and so I started to explore the
"Welcome" software, loaded from a tape via a sequence of squeaks and growls
(representing the bytes to load into the computer's memory). Since I would have
only been eight at the time the
<a href="static/files/BBC_User_Guide.pdf">user guide</a> was beyond my understanding,
so a trip to the local library furnished me with a new book aimed at kids who
wanted to play games on their computers. The book in question was

<p>The first proper program I ever typed into the BBC can be found on page 5. It's
a sort of text based rocket pilot game... you have to take off before the

<p>I have a vivid memory of my aunt, uncle and cousins visiting at the
time. My cousin Michael (five years older than me) shared a fascination with
computers. As a teenager he was clearly at a more advanced level of
understanding, and it was from him that I got lots of tips, tricks and
encouragement to goof around.</p>
<p>So I did.</p>
<p>I changed line 160 to read:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nl">160</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">PRINT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"YOU ARE AN IDIOT"</span>
</pre>

<p>Then I persuaded my unsuspecting Uncle Colin to play.</p>
<p>Since he's an engineer I think he got the
impression there was some sort of simulated Newtonian mechanics going on and
took it quite seriously. Of course, if you read the code, it's just a glorified
guessing game. When he inevitably failed to take off, I remember he exclaimed
"how rude", muttered something about the computer being broken then wandered
off to escape any further computer-related space piloting catastrophes. But my
eight-year-old self was delighted. I spent the next ten minutes laughing
like a maniac at having hoodwinked an adult with my modified code.</p>
<p>Emboldened by this turn of events (and Michael's mischievous teenager-y
encouragement) I soon graduated to a new form of entertainment when dragged
shopping by my parents. I'd wander off on my own to find the computer
stands in retailers. Being a kid, I was mostly ignored as I typed code into
the demonstration machines.</p>
<p>Code like this:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nl">10</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">CLS</span>
<span class="nl">20</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">PRINT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"YOU ARE AN IDIOT"</span>
<span class="nl">30</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">GOTO</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nl">20</span>
</pre>

<p>I'd walk away (after typing <code>RUN</code>) and surreptitiously observe the next person
to encounter the demonstration machines... all telling them they were an idiot
ad infinitum. I soon realised the shop assistants could clear my
school-boy silliness by pressing the <code>ESCAPE</code> or <code>BREAK</code> keys. Yet I also
realised it was possible for the function of such keys to be modified: some of
the code ran on my school's BBC micro clearly made sure any accidental or
deliberate use of <code>ESCAPE</code> or <code>BREAK</code> didn't interfere with whatever
software the teacher had set up for us to use.</p>
<p>I had to wait for the next visit of my cousin Michael to learn how to "improve"
my code so it defeated shop assistants. To cut a long story short it's possible
to rebind the <code>ESCAPE</code> and <code>BREAK</code> keys to the extent that the only way to stop
the machine from doing what it's doing is to switch it off and on again. My
cousin pointed out that the answers to such problems could be found in the
(afore linked) user guide. In fact rebinding <code>BREAK</code> was explained on page 143
and disabling <code>ESCAPE</code> involved this magic incantation at the start of your
source code:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nl">10</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="vg">FX</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="il">200</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="il">3</span>
</pre>

<p>I was off!</p>
<p>Most importantly, I realised the user guide wasn't a boring manual for adults
but, if approached in the right way, it was the source of all sorts of useful
knowledge and information and I merely had to figure out how to find it. I was
also helped by yet-more-computer-books from Usborne and my local library, a
subscription to
<a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=acorn+user&amp;sin=&amp;and%5B%5D=mediatype%3A%22texts%22">Acorn User Magazine</a>
and various aspects of the BBC's magnificent
<a href="https://clp.bbcrewind.co.uk/">Computer Literacy Project</a>,
including TV programmes like this one:</p>
<div class="video-container">

</div>

<p>You can <a href="https://clp.bbcrewind.co.uk/programmes">watch all the original 146 programmes online</a>.</p>
<p>But in the end I learned an important ethical lesson.</p>
<p>After leaving my unstoppable and mildly
insulting code running on a BBC micro at the Mansfield branch of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHSmith">WHSmith</a>, I was horrified to see one of
the retail assistants reprimanded by their supervisor. My joke wasn't funny and
I realised my code had consequences for others. A lesson that stays with me
to this day.</p>
<p>I also learned that revealing technical skill and knowledge can be tricky and,
at times, intimidating to others.</p>
<p>I remember getting a severe telling-off after I tried to help one of my
parent's teaching colleagues, the subject matter specialist for computing. I
was still at Primary school (probably around ten years old) and the ensuing
conversation, in front of my class mates, revealed the teacher's ignorance of
some aspect of how the BBC micro created sounds.</p>
<p>The conversation went something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TEACHER: "You can only make sounds like <em>this</em>."<br>
ME: "But Mrs.S, it's easier to make sounds like <strong>that</strong>."<br>
TEACHER: "You're wrong Nicholas. That simply won't work."<br>
ME: "Oh yes it will."<br>
(I demonstrate the damn thing working.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my enthusiasm to share a cool hack, I undermined the teacher and paid the
price with a bollocking.</p>
<p>To be clear, I wasn't rude. But I was certainly a confident enough ten-year-old
to know I had an easier way to make things work, while being naive to think
this would be welcomed. To be fair, I don't think they did themselves any
favours by telling me it simply wouldn't work. A more open minded teacher would
have said something like, "OK Nicholas, show me your way and let's compare
notes", and used the situation as an opportunity for learning. Yet, as a former
teacher myself, I know that it's often impossible to go off piste in a tightly
structured or time constrained lesson.</p>
<p>Such reminiscences are a prelude to the real digital archaeology.</p>
<p>Last year I found my old BBC micro, and a box full of floppy disks, in my
parent's loft. With their permission I took my finds to the UK's
<a href="https://www.tnmoc.org/">National Museum of Computing</a> (based at Bletchley Park
~ a mere 15 minute drive from where I live). I'll describe the details in a
follow-up post, but with the generous help of others, I was able to extract the
content of the disks.</p>
<p>By way of preview, <a href="https://bbc.godbolt.org/?&amp;disc1=https://ntoll.org/static/bbcdiscs/music.ssd&amp;autoboot" target="_blank">this link takes you to an online BBC emulator running a
sort of "greatest hits" compilation of programmed musical performances</a>.</p>
<p>I put together the disk
from various sources floating around my friendship group, and included some of
my own code too. The disk's menu system is of my own creation but based upon
two other fragments of code I found in a magazine: one for driving a disk menu,
the other for using arrow keys for selecting items. I'm also responsible for
the rather awful renditions of "The Swan" and "The Road Goes Ever On" (a
musical setting of some of J.R.R.Tolkien's poetry from the Lord of the Rings,
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Swann">Donald Swann</a>). If I remember
correctly, I was thirteen years old (in year 9, 1987) when I put this disk
together. As we'll see in future posts, it was a significant year for me in
terms of coding and music.</p>
<p>Use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to navigate the menu. Keys like
<code>RETURN</code> (to make a selection) and <code>ESCAPE</code> (to stop a piece and return to the
menu) will behave as usual. However, I'm sorry to report I used the <code>*FX 200,3</code>
trick with "The Swan" ~ you're just going to have to sit through that
monstrosity in its entirety without the use of the <code>ESCAPE</code> key.</p>
<p>"You're welcome", says my thirteen year old self. ;-)</p>
<p>This is but a small example of some of the fascinating things I've found.</p>
<p>In future posts I'll reveal more about my programming, dive a little
into the technology I was using and try to place it all into the context of
my life at the time. As some of you already know, I'm actually a classically
trained musician, and this has some bearing on what I've managed to find... or
more accurately, what I've managed to find has some bearing on why I'm a
classically trained musician, who works as a software engineer with a passion
for computing education.</p>
<p>Finally, it turns out that the BBC micro didn't
<a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/the-legacy-of-bbc-micro/">create a legacy of fond memories and technical skill just for me</a>.
There are many folks of my age who have similar stories to tell.</p>
<p>Happy new year! More soon...</p>

    <p>It was an extraordinary privilege to be one of the keynote speakers at this
year's <a href="https://gh.pycon.org/">PyCon Ghana</a>. I was also very lucky to have the
support of my employer (<a href="https://anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a>) who covered the
costs associated with the trip for myself and my colleague,

<p>While this was my first trip to Ghana (actually, it was my first trip to
Africa), this was not my first Ghanaian interaction.</p>
<p>I can't begin to describe how important and nourishing the stimulating
interactions I've had with Ghana based friends Mannie and Michael have been.
Two years ago we were introduced by our mutual friend Conrad Ho, and since then
have met every month, in video calls, to discuss Python in education. The work
done by the Ghanaian Python community to engage in educational activities is
truly inspiring, and you can find out more
<a href="https://www.pythonghana.org/">here</a>.</p>
<p>That both Mannie and Michael are part of the PyCon Ghana organising team, and
this year's focus was on Python in education give a clue as to how I got
invited.</p>
<figure><img src="images/accra.jpg" alt="A view from our accommodation"><figcaption>The view of Accra from our accommodation.</figcaption></figure><p>After an eventful flight to Accra, both Cheuk and I went exploring during our
first full day. Adjacent to our accommodation was Oxford Street, containing
lots of shops, banks and other useful things we needed to visit. My immediate
impression was very positive... the Ghanaian folk we met were all friendly
and welcoming. "Good morning", "Hello", "Welcome to Ghana" and other such
greetings were common as we walked through the streets.</p>
<p>We also met the PyCon Ghana organisers at the venue. Having been involved with
community organising for well over a decade, I looked on in sympathy and (where
possible) got stuck in trying to help get everything set up. Like most aspects
of the Python community, PyCon Ghana is run by volunteers, and I'd like to
acknowledge their strength of character, friendliness and can-do attitude, led
by their chair, Francis. I saw first hand, that the Ghanaian Python community
is in good hands.</p>
<p>Sadly, I was ill on Thursday's tutorial day. My son had shared his cold with
me and it meant I had to stay home instead of attend Cheuk's amazing
<a href="https://humbledata.org/">humble data</a> workshop. But the enforced day of rest
meant I was ready for Friday and Saturday at the conference.</p>
<p>I was honoured to meet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nii_Quaynor">Nii Quaynor</a>
a Ghanaian gentleman who is often described as the father of the African
internet and an inductee to the <a href="https://www.internethalloffame.org/">Internet Hall of Fame</a>.
Nii eloquently spoke with considerable experience and authority of the
challenges and opportunities for working with governmental and international
agencies. I hope folks were paying attention since the Python community
in Ghana could be a significant contributor and collaborator in the technical
growth of the country.</p>
<p>There were also many other interesting talks, panels and workshops happening at
the event which made it feel like a typical Python conference found anywhere in
the world.</p>
<p>My first proper contribution to the conference was to run a two day workshop
on MicroPython on the micro:bit for young people. I have to say this was an
absolute joy and, assisted by Anthony and Joanna, we were also joined by
a collection of teachers, tech folk and IoT curious. The vibe was friendly and
the young people brought lots of energy and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Here's a video, shot on the second day while folks were building a project with
their micro:bit, to give a flavour of what went on.</p>

<p>Many thanks to the <a href="https://microbit.org/">MicroBit Foundation</a> for supporting
PyCon Ghana via the donation of 20 devices for participants to use and then
keep. Every device found a safe home, with many asking where they can be
obtained in Ghana..!</p>
<p>My keynote, on the subject of Python in Education, went well and as usual, I
especially enjoyed answering the questions at the end.</p>
<p>I was especially pleased to channel my "inner teacher" by (half jokingly)
setting the conference some homework.</p>
<p>I pointed out that somewhere will become known as a place of African technical
innovation. Somewhere will be lauded as having the most accessible and
creative coding education programme in Africa. Somewhere will famously
contribute a uniquely African story to our global technical community.</p>
<p>I asked, "why not you..?".</p>
<p>My homework task to the audience was to discover and become their own unique,
colourful and extraordinary community. They already have a small but strong,
vibrant and close knit nucleus from which to grow.</p>
<p>I hope, in ten years time,
to visit Ghana again and have some of today's community say to me, "see what
we did, and look where we're going...", and for me to be amazed.</p>
<figure><img src="images/ghana.jpg" alt="Ghanaian friends."><figcaption>Ghanaian friends.</figcaption></figure><p>Another aspect of the conference was its friendliness.</p>
<p>During the breaks I
spoke to many different people, from all over Africa, and drew energy from
their passion, enthusiasm and openness.</p>
<p>I also enjoyed the warmth of their
conversation and willingness to share games with me... I especially appreciated
learning how to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oware">Oware</a> from PyCon
Ghana organiser, Hillary. I enjoyed it so much I managed to buy a board in a
market in Accra and have taught my kids and wife how to play..! It's a big hit
in our house.</p>
<figure><img src="images/accra_beach.jpg" alt="The amazing view of a beach from the old presidential residence."><figcaption>The amazing view of a beach from the old presidential residence.</figcaption></figure><p>On my final day, the day after the conference, we hung out with the conference
organisers and visited tourist sites in Accra. It was wonderful to see
non-Pythonic aspects of Ghana... its cultural spaces, historic monuments, the
university and glimpse some of its natural beauty.</p>
<p>Through the course of my stay, I saw the twi word "akwaaba" in many places.</p>
<p>When I asked what it meant I was told it was a sort of very hospitable form of
"welcome".</p>
<p>"Akwaaba" is a pretty good word to describe my experience of PyCon Ghana.</p>
<p>Long may the Ghanaian Python community flourish and I look forward to 2032. ;-)</p>
