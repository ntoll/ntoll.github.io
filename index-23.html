<h3>Why Computers Work (part 2)</h3>

<p>Just as one can describe rules for a card game, it is possible to describe
rules for thinking: rules for movement of thought.</p>
<p>This is the study of <em>Logic</em>, and using these rules is called <em>reasoning</em>.
Reasoning with logical rules allows others, who know such rules, to follow the
movements of thought that brought you to a certain conclusion. Furthermore,
because there are rules, it's possible to notice when they're ignored or used
incorrectly (when movements of thought don't make logical sense).</p>
<p>There are many types of logic, but the one we're going to examine is called
propositional (or sentential, or boolean) logic.</p>
<p>"Propositional" and "sentential" are just descriptive names for a type of
logic that deals with forming sentences by combining propositions. In logic,
<em>propositions make assertions that are either true or false</em>.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole" target="_blank">George
Boole</a> (1815-1864), shown below, invented a system of mathematical algebra
that works like propositional logic (it also deals with values that are either
true or false) and so the term "boolean" is often used synonymously.</p>

<figure><img src="images/boole.png" alt="George Boole"><figcaption><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Portrait_of_George_Boole.png" target="_blank">Source</a>
  - this image is in the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain" target="_blank">public domain</a>.
</figcaption></figure><p>Here's a contrived example of a sentence in propositional logic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If it is sunny and I am wearing a thick coat, then I am hot."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to draw your attention to some important aspects of this sentence that
may not, at first, appear obvious:</p>
<ul>
<li>It contains two propositions called <em>premises</em> ("it is sunny" and "I am
  wearing a thick coat"). Premises make assertions about <em>states of affairs</em>.</li>
<li>It ends with a <em>conclusion</em> ("I am hot"). A conclusion is a <em>proposition that
  depends upon the premises</em> in some way.</li>
<li>The sentence is in the form of a <em>conditional</em> ("if [premises], then
  [conclusion]"). A conditional is a rule saying that if its premises are true
  then the conclusion <strong>must be true</strong>.</li>
<li>The premises are related to each other by a <em>logical operator</em> called a
  <em>conjunction</em> ("and"). This is another rule: if the related premises are
  evaluated together, <strong>collectively they are true only if all of them are
  true</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Propositional logic describes the rules of a "game" to construct sentences that
make logical sense. Playing by the rules of logic forces everyone to reach the
same inevitable conclusion: if we accept that the premises are true (it is
sunny and I am wearing a coat) propositional logic dictates the conclusion must
be true (I am hot). The object of propositional logic is to use the rules to
evaluate (work out) if a sentence is true or false.</p>
<p>Here's the brain twist: propositional logic doesn't care about meaning. The
important logical aspects of the example above don't concern my state in the
real world (which is why the sentence sounds slightly odd). <em>Propositional
logic only cares about truth and how propositions fit together</em>. I could
revise the example to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If A and B then C."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't matter what <em>A</em>, <em>B</em> or <em>C</em> stand for nor what they may mean -- from
the perspective of propositional logic all that matters is there are two
conjuncted premises (A and B) and a conclusion (C) expressed in a conditional
(if ... then ...). If one or both of the premises is false, then the
conclusion must also be false. Why? Because the logical rules pertaining to
conditionals and conjunctions (<em>and nothing else outside those rules</em>) make it
that way!</p>
<p>The brain twist is divorcing yourself from meaning -- just concern yourself
with truth values of the propositions, the structure of the sentence and
following the rules.</p>
<p>In the same way the
<a href="article/why-computers-1#rules_of_snap">rules of Snap explain what
must happen</a>, given card
related states of affairs, so the rules of propositional logic do the same with
propositions and sentences. The rules of Snap don't care what the specific
values of cards are, just that such values may match. Similarly, propositional
logic doesn't care what the specific meanings of the propositions may be, only
that such propositions connect in a sentence that can be evaluated with rules
dealing in just two possible states: <strong>true</strong> and
<strong>false</strong>.</p>

<p>The simplest way to express the rules that govern such logical operations
for connecting propositions is with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table" target="_blank">truth
table</a>.</p>

<p>Here's the definition of "and" (conjunction):</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code> A | B | A and B
----------------
 F | F |    F
 F | T |    F
 T | F |    F
 T | T |    T
</code></pre>


<p>Can you see how it works?</p>
<p>The first two columns represent propositions labelled "A" and "B". The third
column represents the outcome of the "and" operation, given the values of "A"
and "B" in the first two columns. Each possible combination of truth value for
"A" and "B" is enumerated as a row with the resulting truth value for the "and"
operation in the third column. It's a simple tabular way to express the rules
of propositional logic. If you had any doubt how "and" (conjunction) worked,
you'd find the definitive answer in this truth table.</p>
<p>For instance, take the first row: if propositions "A" and "B" are both false
(as expressed in the first two columns), then the outcome for this rule
(expressed in the third column) <strong>must be false</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's another truth table that defines the rule for the logical operation
called "or" (disjunction):</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code> A | B | A or B
---------------
 F | F |   F
 F | T |   T
 T | F |   T
 T | T |   T
</code></pre>


<p>Let's pretend that "A" is false but "B" is true. How would you evaluate the
truth value of "A or B"? Is it true or false?</p>
<p>The answer is that "A or B" is true. Why? Because the second row tells us so:
the "A" column is false, the "B" column is true so the result, expressed in the
third column, is true.</p>
<p>Here's one final truth table. It's a bit different to the other two since it
only works on a single proposition:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code> A | not A
----------
 T |   F
 F |   T
</code></pre>


<p>It's easy to see what the "not" (negation) operation does to a proposition: it
flips its truth value so false becomes true, and true becomes false.</p>
<p>While these logical operations have familiar names ("and", "or" and "not")
that <strong>appear to relate to how they work</strong>, it is the truth table
<strong>and only the truth table</strong> that defines how they behave in
propositional logic, not any similarity to how we may use such words in
everyday English. There are further rules, expressed as truth tables, for
connecting propositions that you may wish to look into. They are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or" target="_blank">XOR</a>
(eXclusive OR),
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffer_stroke" target="_blank">NAND</a>
(Not AND),
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_NOR" target="_blank">NOR</a>
(Not OR) and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_equality" target="_blank">XNOR</a>
(eXclusive Not OR).</p>

<p>Logical puzzles become fun when you combine such logical operations to build
more complicated structures. Take for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(A and B) or (C or not D)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've put parentheses ("<code>(</code>" and "<code>)</code>") around propositions so you can see how they
relate to the logical operators (the <code>and</code>, <code>or</code> and <code>not</code>). If we pretend all
the propositions represented by letters are false, what is the overall truth
value of the sentence?</p>
<p>To find the answer we play the logical "game" in the same way we would with
Snap: we follow the rules.</p>
<p>Start by evaluating the operators within the parentheses. If we replace the
propositions "A" and "B" with their truth values (remember, all the
propositions are false), we get:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(false and false) or (C or not D)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the rule set out in the truth table for "and", the propositions in the
first parentheses evaluate to false. Here's how the sentence looks as a
result:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>false or (C or not D)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To evaluate the "or" in the remaining parentheses we should first evaluate the
"not" operator to find the truth value of the proposition on the right. If "D"
is false, then the truth table for "not" tells us that "not D" must evaluate to
true. Since "C" is false, the sentence looks like this when "C" and "not D" are
replaced by their truth values:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>false or (false or true)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The truth table for "or", when applied to values in the remaining parentheses
tells us that if one of the propositions is true, then the "or" operation must
evaluate to true, giving us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>false or true</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Re-using this rule to evaluate the remaining "or" operation gives the result:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>true</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>only way</strong> to solve such logical puzzles is by following the inevitable
steps dictated by the rules. That's <em>how</em> logic works!</p>
<p>But <em>why</em> does logic work?</p>
<p>For the same reason why the game of Snap works: we modify our behaviour to
follow unambiguous rules because we want to determine the truth of sentences in
propositional logic (the aim of playing this sort of logic game). Furthermore,
by pretending propositions represent states of affairs in the real world, we
can use logic to describe and, in a sense, encode aspects of the real world.
For instance, we could describe the rules of Snap <em>with logic</em>.</p>
<p>But <em>why</em> is logic useful?</p>
<p>Because logic clearly and unambiguously describes the relationships between
states of affairs (premises), and allows us to take action given a resulting
truth value. Consider, for example, this conditional statement: <code>IF</code> the card
on top of stack A is an ace <code>AND</code> the card on top of stack B is an ace, <code>THEN</code>
shout "SNAP!". Logic describes the movement of thought needed to participate in
the card game (or any other useful structured activity).</p>
<p>Here's a final "brain twist" for you:</p>
<p>If Logic provides an inevitable, almost mechanical framework for organising and
describing movements of thought then we should be able to build machines to
work with such seemingly mechanical logical rules.</p>
<p>It turns out that we can, and describing such machines is the next step in
describing why computers work!</p>

<p>This is the first of five short blog posts exploring <em>why computers work</em>.</p>
<p>I'm going to present a friendly introductory overview for laypeople, from zero
to Turing machines, automata, abstraction and more. My aim is conciseness and
clarity, so I've necessarily missed out, glossed over and simplified things.
There are plenty of more advanced resources online should you wish to
investigate this subject further.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I hope to stimulate your thinking about computers by creating
a place to explore ideas.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy these articles and, as always, I love getting constructive

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Computers are ubiquitous.</p>
<p>They touch all aspects of our lives, from mediating our social interactions to
modelling aspects of our culture and managing the everyday infrastructure of
society.</p>
<p>Therefore, computers are interesting and, understandably, folks want to
know <strong>how</strong> the machines that automate and control so much of our world work.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q" target="_blank">This is
a typical response</a>.</p>

<p>I'm going to take a different approach.</p>
<p>I'm going to explore <strong>why</strong> computers work.</p>
<p>What's the difference?</p>
<p>Answers to "how?" questions tell us what method or steps make something happen.
In contrast, the answers to "why?" questions describe what makes something
possible ~ an opportunity to encounter a more fundamental perspective.</p>
<p>It's the difference between a car mechanic who may understand <em>how</em> an engine
works (so they can fix broken engines), and a mechanical engineer who
understands the physics and chemistry relating to <em>why</em> engines work (so they
can improve the design of engines). Knowing how something works means your
frame of reference is <em>within the system</em>, whereas if you understand why
something works you're not bound by existing products, solutions or cultural
practices.</p>
<p>Most importantly, cultivating an understanding of why something is possible is
an invitation for playful creativity, fearless exploration and careful
refinement of alternatives to the current crop of answers to "how?". It is an
opportunity to enlarge and change our world ~ a form of intellectual
empowerment and growth.</p>
<p>Knowing <em>how</em> is good, but understanding <em>why</em> is better.</p>
<p>With the scene suitably set, to start our journey, we'll learn all about...</p>
<h3>Following Rules</h3>
<p>Do you know how to play the children's card game, Snap?</p>
<p>(Bear with me, I promise it'll be worth it.)</p>
<p>Using a standard deck of cards, the aim is to win all the cards by <em>taking
turns to play</em>.</p>
<p>Let's follow along as siblings Penelope (11), Sam (8) and Will (5) play a game:</p>
<p>Penelope (for no other reason than she's the oldest) acts as dealer. She
shuffles the deck of cards so they're in a random order and deals them, face
down and in equal quantity, to each player until there are none left to deal.
This is the starting state from which all games of Snap begin.</p>
<p>Sam, the player to the left of the dealer, takes the first turn.</p>
<p>Players take a turn by moving the top card from their face-down stack onto the
top of an adjacent stack of face-up cards, so the newly moved card is also
facing up. Since this is Sam's first turn, the face-up stack doesn't exist,
so a new stack is created with Sam's first face-up card taken from his pile of
face-down cards.</p>
<p>So ends Sam's turn.</p>
<figure><img src="images/snap.jpg" alt="A game of Snap!"><figcaption><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Snap" target="_blank">Source</a> - From
  <a href="https://www.wikihow.com" target="_blank">WikiHow</a> and licensed
  under

</figcaption></figure><p>The next player to the left, William, takes his turn in a similar fashion and
so the game continues from one player to the next.</p>
<p>After a while Sam shouts "SNAP". He's noticed that two face-up cards on top of
different stacks have the same value (for example, two aces are visible on top
of Penelope and Will's stacks). Since he was first to shout "SNAP" he wins all
the cards in the matching stacks of cards. He gleefully scoops up all the cards
in the face-up stacks belonging to Penelope and Will.</p>
<p>Play continues to the left of the player who turned up the matching card.</p>
<p>A few moments later Penelope shouts "SNAP". But there is a problem: there are
no matching face-up cards! William points this out to Penelope and reminds her
she has to pay a forfeit by giving one card to each of the other players from
her face-down stack. Sam and Will get a card each and Penelope is two cards
down.</p>
<p>At this point in the game Sam has the most cards. Will and Penelope have less
with only a few cards difference between the quantities in their face-down
stacks.</p>
<p>Things are hotting up and the three children become more excited: when two
matching face-up cards appear again all three of them shout "SNAP" at the same
time. Since nobody can claim to have shouted "SNAP" first, and to avoid
arguments, both the matching stacks are placed in the middle and added to the
"Snap pool". When "SNAP" is next called unambiguously and correctly, the winner
will get both the matching stacks and any cards in the "Snap pool". The stakes
have suddenly got higher.</p>
<p>Things quieten down for a few rounds until Penelope runs out of face-down cards
to put onto her face-up stack. At this point she simply flips over her face-up
stack and it becomes her face-down stack. Play continues as before.</p>
<p>Eventually, after a few more calls of "SNAP", Penelope finds that she's run out
of cards and so out of the game.</p>
<p>Sam and Will play together until, through luck and fast reactions, Sam finds
himself with all the cards and he's declared the winner of the game.</p>
<p>That's how you play Snap..!</p>
<p id="rules_of_snap">The rules illustrated in this deliberately precise story describe
<em>how</em>, given certain states of affairs, such-and-such things must
happen. States of affairs unambiguously describe how things are in the world.
For example, "there are two stacks of face-up cards whose top cards are of
matching value". When I describe how such-and-such must happen, I mean clear
and unambiguous instructions describe <em>how</em> play proceeds given a
certain state of affairs.</p>

<p>Put simply, this is <em>how</em> the game of Snap is played.</p>
<p>But <em>why</em> is Snap played?</p>
<p>Because, in addition to knowing the rules, we understand that playing the game
of Snap means modifying one's behaviour to follow these rules. If everyone
modifies their behaviour in accordance with the rules then folks can play
together. Obviously, we don't explain card games in such a formal manner to
very young children. But, as my description shows, children discover it's lots
of fun to informally learn and skilfully follow rules that bring about
exciting situations in games.</p>
<p>Knowing how to play Snap is analogous to knowing how computers work. Looking
beyond the rules of Snap to appreciate that human behaviour and enjoyment
motivates people to follow the rules of the game, shows us <em>why</em> Snap is
played. This insight may also inspire us to invent new games. Perhaps we become
inspired to explore further aspects of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment" target="_blank">human behaviour relating to following rules</a>,
or we may even
<a href="https://theoryoffun.com/" target="_blank">reflect upon the nature of play or games</a>.
In any case, exploring <em>why</em> rather than <em>how</em> provides a
fascinating perspective from outside the system (of Snap, in this case).</p>

<p>We need to achieve an analogous enlargement of perspective beyond <em>how</em>
computers work in order to understand <em>why</em> computers work. Only by acquiring a
perspective outside current norms can we possibly hope to invent or improve
technology and explore the nature and use of such devices. The alternative is
churn and recycling of existing ideas within the current system ~ a situation
that stifles innovation or positive change.</p>
<p>The computing-related rules and states of affairs I'm going to describe are not
much more complicated than the game of Snap explained above. However, what
follows may include a few <em>brain twists</em> where I expect you to use your
imagination to see things in a seemingly unusual or unintuitive way! I'm
challenging you to acquire a new perspective about seemingly everyday things.
The external world remains as it was before, but you will have changed. Your
newly acquired perspective reveals a deeper understanding of what you're
observing and why this makes computing possible. It's fun and can result in
rather pleasant "aha" moments (if you were a cartoon character, it's that
feeling you get when a lightbulb appears above your head).</p>
<p>The next chapter in our story is a beautiful brain twist: to think about
thinking...</p>
