out a shorter walk, and one with which we were familiar, on day 7. We were in
Mary's part of the world (the beautiful Shropshire hills) and so we found
ourselves driving to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiperstones"&gt;Stiperstones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa7/stiperselfie.jpg" alt="The two of us walking along the ridge at Stiperstones." title="The two of us walking along the ridge at Stiperstones"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The two of us on the ridge at Stiperstones.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived relatively early in the morning and easily found a parking space,
gingerly put on our boots and started to make our ascent. Given we were both
injured in some sense (me with my blisters and Mary with her knee) we went at a
slow and steady pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa7/stiperstones.jpg" alt="An outcrop at Stiperstones." title="An outcrop at Stiperstones"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;An outcrop at Stiperstones.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once at the top of the ridge (one of the highest points in Shropshire), the
outcrops of quartzite rock make obvious waypoints for hiking. We found several
folks &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering"&gt;bouldering&lt;/a&gt; on the rock
formations and paused to watch them and take in the glorious views and drink in
the fresh clear air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa7/underfoot.jpg" alt="Conditions underfoot at Stiperstones." title="Conditions underfoot at Stiperstones"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Very poor conditions under foot at Stiperstones.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conditions underfoot on many parts of the ridge are not good, and it's easy to
go over on one's ankle or painfully stub a toe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our slowness was thus more compounded by both the injuries and rough-shod rocks
strewn all over the paths. Yet we made progress and walked the full extent of
the ridge in glorious sunshine and accompanied by larks chirruping
away:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;q&gt;He rises and begins to round,&lt;br&gt;
He drops the silver chain of sound&lt;br&gt;
Of many links without a break,&lt;br&gt;
In chirrup, whistle, slur and shake,&lt;br&gt;
All intervolv’d and spreading wide,&lt;br&gt;
Like water-dimples down a tide&lt;br&gt;
Where ripple ripple overcurls&lt;br&gt;
And eddy into eddy whirls;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://allpoetry.com/The-Lark-Ascending"&gt;The Lark Ascending&lt;/a&gt; ~ George Meredith&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All told we walked almost five miles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="map-day7" style="height: 400px"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon we visited the small town of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop's_Castle"&gt;Bishop's Castle&lt;/a&gt;,
having heard the high street contained a number of book shops and a
&lt;a href="https://poetrypharmacy.co.uk/"&gt;Poetry Pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;, which sounded like it was
just what we needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa7/bishops-castle.jpg" alt="Bishop's Castle high street." title="Bishop's Castle high street."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The high street at Bishop's Castle - including a poetry pharmacy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end we spent most of our time in the wonderful &lt;a href="https://www.hocmuseum.org.uk/"&gt;House on Crutches Museum&lt;/a&gt;
where I was able to examine some of the old brass instruments from the former
town band (not in a good state), and learn all about local
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_dance"&gt;Morris dancing&lt;/a&gt; troupes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poetry pharmacy was another highlight, although I was unable to find
anything to read that suited my mood. Perhaps, given that I usually have my
nose in a book, this holiday is also a holiday from reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening we stayed near &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welshpool"&gt;Welshpool&lt;/a&gt;
and found evidence of the local knitting circle's guerilla Easter decoration
operation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day started with a drive to lake Vyrnwy (you pronounce it,
"ver-in-wee"). The lake is man-made and to reach the car park involves crossing
this rather imposing dam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa7/vyrnwy-dam.jpg" alt="The dam at Lake Vyrnwy." title="The dam at Lake Vyrnwy."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The imposing dam at Lake Vyrnwy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We timed our arrival perfectly since the car park was empty and hardly anyone
appeared to be around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to walk around the lake until we found a quiet beach on which we
could sit, relax and simply ponder the world. It can't have taken more than 20
minutes to find such an isolated spot, and we spent over two hours just
chatting, relaxing or throwing skimmers into the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the morning we were joined by various passers-by: a young
family, a Polish couple with their daughter, a group of students. Everyone was
friendly and happy to be by the lakeside and the opportunity for moments of
reflection that it offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Lake Vyrnwy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our walk back to the car we appeared to meet a bank holiday weekend tour for
the "young fellers with souped-up cars" motoring club. The sound of noisy
exhausts, the look of go-faster stripes and the thinness of sports tyres
(clearly, for country roads) were much in evidence. A massive traffic jam was
also in evidence as the posse (what is the correct plural noun?) of young men
in souped up cars, took on the overweight hairy bikers and caravan owners in a
three way battle for the junction leading to the dam. It wasn't a pretty sight
as helpful bikers attempted to direct the traffic, only to be ignored by one of
the other tribes (in the end, the old fellers just stood in the way of the
traffic to control the flow). Well, done to the hairy bikers for their public
service!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took our time getting back to the car, not wishing to be involved in the
traffic chaos, but in the end the blockages had been cleared and the route to
the dam was clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up driving to our overnight rest stop at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llanymynech"&gt;Llanymynech&lt;/a&gt;
and spent some time exploring the remains of the lime industry in the area.
This included a lovely walk in some woods reclaiming the area used for
processing and delivering treated lime into barges on the Shropshire Union
canal. Among the thickets we found a huge abandoned lime kiln.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa7/lime-kilns.jpg" alt="Lime kilns in Llanymynech." title="Lime kilns in Llanymynech."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Lime kilns in Llanymynech.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today started with a trip to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirk_Castle"&gt;Chirk Castle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As members of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Trust"&gt;National Trust&lt;/a&gt;
we got in for free and spent the morning wandering the amazing gardens and
grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa7/chirk_castle.jpg" alt="Chirk Castle." title="Chirk Castle."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Chirk Castle.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gardens ranged from managed woodland to formal gardens with statues and
topiary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa7/chirk_formal_gardens.jpg" alt="Chirk gardens." title="Chirk gardens."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Chirk gardens.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the castle were displays depicting different aspects of the castle's
history, including the dungeon, the clockwork for the clock tower, the
servant's hall and a collection of knight's helmets. These final items made
me smile, as each helmet appears to bear a different expression, much like a
medieval metal emoji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;A selection of knight's helmets.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon we visited the town of Llangollen. It being bank holiday
Monday, the small town was heaving with visitors (like us) and the tourist
traps were doing a swift trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highlight was watching canoeists tackle the Dee river running through the
town (they had hung slalom gates over the river). This led us to the railway
station, run by volunteer enthusiasts, and we ended up escaping the scrum of
tourists by taking a trip up the valley in an open train to the village of
Berwyn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;The river Dee at Llangollen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we enter the final stretch of our holiday, we're both starting to feel like
all this relaxing and touring is quite tiring. It means our holiday has done
its job: we're looking forward to throwing ourselves back into our usual day to
day routines.&lt;/p&gt;

(but not actual) closeness to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machynlleth"&gt;Machynlleth&lt;/a&gt;
to visit
the &lt;a href="https://cat.org.uk/"&gt;Centre for Alternative Technology&lt;/a&gt; (CAT) - an
inspiring organisation that specialises in sustainable living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first visited CAT back in 1995, it turned out to be a perfect day both
of us fondly remember. We have returned several times since and enjoyed
watching the site, educational work and influence of the CAT organisation 
flourish and grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone fascinated with technology (and I'll informally define that as,
&lt;em&gt;crafting the world through creativity and coherent invention to better engage
and interact with it to some valuable aim or benefit&lt;/em&gt;), the "alternative" part
of the CAT name has always appealed to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a software engineer, a job most folks imagine is at the heart of "new" or
"hi"-tech. Yet I, and many of my colleagues, will tell you that "new"
and "hi"-tech is not necessarily the same as "good". The focus on "alternative"
appeals to the engineer in me: it means I'm not constrained to frame my
thinking via the tired stereotypes found in our culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example of what I mean is the first thing you see upon arrival at CAT, a
water powered funicular railway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa6/water_powered_rail.jpg" alt="Arrival at the Centre for Alternative Technology involves ascending a mountain in a water powered funicular railway." title="Arrival at the Centre for Alternative Technology involves ascending a mountain in a water powered funicular railway."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Arrival at the Centre for Alternative Technology involves ascending a mountain in a water powered funicular railway.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly there is a lot of technology going on here, but it's not a computing
"tech" mode of transport like a Segway or self-driving car. If you
understand simple physics, it's easy to figure out how it works. That it runs
on water, an abundant resource in rainy Wales, means the energy cost of running
the system is very small and doesn't involve polluting the environment
(rather, it complements and integrates the ambient environmental conditions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa6/the_lake.jpg" alt="The lake at the top of the railway is the source of the water." title="The lake at the top of the railway is the source of the water."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The lake at the top of the railway is the source of the water.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like this enlarged view of technology, beyond just the thing being imagined
or a "tech" mode of creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustainability, impact and
the life-cycle of the "tech" is carefully considered. This is a very
different approach to "smaller, faster, cheaper" gizmos and apps inflicted upon
"consumers", created and made with a development process based on the mantra of
"&lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/1428/"&gt;move fast and break things&lt;/a&gt;",
whose aim is to maximise shareholder profit. Put simply, there is a
philosophical aspect to tech that is, in my experience, often missing or
actively discouraged in "tech" culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, we chose to take part in the guided tour because we wanted to see and
hear about the centre from our guide: someone intimate with the ethos and
practicalities of such an enlarged outlook to technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being
semi-regular visitors over the past 27 years or more, both Mary and I learned
so much from our guide, Joel, who patiently fielded questions and engaged our
group both with the story of CAT and the various things found therein (such as
modular &lt;a href="http://www.segalselfbuild.co.uk"&gt;Segal method&lt;/a&gt; buildings, or the
diverse number of energy solutions, such as the hydroelectric
generator shown below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa6/water_power.jpg" alt="The hydroelectric generator." title="The hydroelectric generator."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The flow of water from the top lake to the lake used by the railway drives the hydroelectric generator.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CAT is a very stimulating and eye-opening place, with much of the location taken over with
practical educational projects that both illustrate and explain the many
aspects of "alternative" technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a teacher, I enjoyed their approach to engaging with folks wishing to learn.
Rather than a "how to use" video or documentation that fills your head with
facts, we were left to experiment
and engage directly with "alternative" tech. For instance, the
wind-powered seat (shown below), beautifully illustrated how little wind is
needed to achieve some useful end (in this case, lift and lower a person).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa6/wind_powered_chair.jpg" alt="A wind powered chair that moves up and down." title="A wind powered chair that moves up and down."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A wind powered chair gently moves the occupant up and down.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you don't see in this photograph of me sitting on the chair, is the
relatively small windmill attached by a pulley system to the seat. I have to
say this was a pleasantly gentle and rather fun way to prove a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architecture is also an important aspect of CAT, with many of the buildings
demonstrating interesting approaches to creating space for living, working and
enjoying life. Often unusual but sustainably sourced
materials are used (straw bale, or rammed earth for instance) and those aspects
of the building are thoughtfully brought to visitor's attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAT is also a thriving educational organisation and, while we were wandering
the site, we noticed groups of students learning about "alternative" technology
in buildings built with such technology, created by the folks running the
educational programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rather like the directness of this approach. If I were
a student looking to engage with these things, who wouldn't want to learn in
such a way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa6/conference_centre.jpg" alt="The sustainably built conference and education centre." title="The sustainably built conference and education centre."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The sustainably designed and built conference and education centre.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, CAT isn't just about "alternative" tech, but also contains information
about alternative uses of "traditional" tech. For instance, as a
space-nut, I was fascinated by their interactive display on using small earth
observation satellites to gather data and monitor changes in the landscape.
Space bound technology is no longer just the preserve of large governmental
agencies like NASA, and the open data received can be put to all sorts of
interesting and important uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;A small earth observation satellite.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're ever in mid-Wales, I heartily recommend CAT. Mary and I have always
had thought provoking visits.
Clearly CAT won't appeal to everyone, but nobody can ignore their hard work to
promote a much needed different perspective... an alternative vision of
"technology".&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://ntoll.org/article/offas-dyke-6/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2022 06:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Offa's Dyke - Days 3, 4 and 5:</title><link>https://ntoll.org/article/offas-dyke-3-4-5/</link><dc:creator>Nicholas H.Tollervey</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Our meal at the end of day 2 was lots of fun. As we walked into the
pub we met again the lady who had found Mary's phone on day 1, struck up a
conversation, and she joined us for a sociable evening of chatter over rustic
grub. It turned out Caroline was a teacher and so we had a fine old time
going over teacher talk. We shared classroom based triumphs and tragedies and
the usual moans and gripes about the state of the education "system"
that all teachers appear to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning, as expected, it was raining and the country was covered in
low rolling mist. Nevertheless we set off in good spirits and determined to
climb up onto the ridge for the views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little did we know how different our situation would be by the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa3/setting_out.jpg" alt="Walking towards the Black Mountains." title="Walking towards the Black Mountains."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Walking towards the Black Mountains, in the rain.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a couple of relatively swift miles tramping the rolling countryside to
Pandy, we started to ascend the edge of the Black Mountains. Since we were
laden with all our clobber this took a while: but our mantra was "slow and
steady does it". We could have stomped up, like I usually do, but we decided to
save ourselves for the 15 miles of walking over the ridge we would need to
complete to get us to Hay-on-Wye by the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first sight to greet us upon completing our ascent was an ancient hill
fort from pre-Roman times. Even after 2500-3000 years, the dykes and ditches
that marked the boundaries of the fort were an imposing site, especially as
they loomed ominously out of the mist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa3/hill_fort.jpg" alt="The ramparts of a 2500 year old hill fort." title="The ramparts of a 2500 year old hill fort."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The ramparts of a 2500 year old hill fort.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, it was at this point, we resigned ourselves to the fact that the
weather would be against us for the day. There would be no beautiful views
over mountains or down into valleys for us. In fact, we could only see about 20
metres ahead of ourselves. Fortunately the path for the Offa's Dyke trail was
obvious, so we just had to trudge on (and on, and on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to remain motivated when all around you is freezing fog. There's no
sense of progress and it's impossible to look back to see how far you've come,
or look ahead to a marker in the distance as a target to aim for. Yet sometimes
we would pass way-points that marked the tops of peaks, and this photo, taken
perhaps just before lunchtime, is a good indication of our conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa3/wet_conditions.jpg" alt="Wet conditions on the ridge." title="Wet conditions on the ridge."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Wet conditions on the ridge.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also felt quite alone: by lunch we hadn't met a soul. Yet we were not the
only ones tramping the hills that day. Huge piles of steaming dung alerted
us to the presence of others, just out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then suddenly, we came upon the group of wild horses grazing the grass.
They took a look at us, pondered for a few seconds why on earth two humans
would be up there with them, and then returned to the more pressing task of
grazing again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa3/wild_horses.jpg" alt="Wild horses." title="Wild horses."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Wild horses.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point mid-afternoon the conditions under-foot became much more boggy
and the path turned into a set of paving slabs. We joked that Offa must have
sourced them from the local garden centre...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa3/offas_paving_slabs.jpg" alt="Offa's paving slabs." title="Offa's paving slabs."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Offa's paving slabs.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...but we were thankful that they helped us avoid tramping through the black
peaty mud. Perhaps this is how the mountains got their "black" name?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also started to realise that not all was well for either of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My feet and ankles ached and while Mary found it comfortable to walk up hills,
and over the levels, descending was very painful because of her right knee.
This got gradually worse throughout the day, to the point that it couldn't be
ignored, and we started to talk about what we might do about the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from this photo, we were determined to put a brave face on
things but I think we both realised things were not going as they should (we're
no longer spring chickens!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa3/afternoon_snack.jpg" alt="Drying off for an afternoon snack." title="Drying off for an afternoon snack."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Drying off for an afternoon snack.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, around mid-afternoon we met the first people of the day. Two fellow
walkers appeared out of the mist towards us, and we shared some encouraging
words. Yet just as we were commenting how deserted the ridge was, a young
man came from the same direction as us at a fast pace. He stopped to
say a quick "hello" only to realise his small back-pack had come undone. He
checked his things (nothing missing), re-adjusted his equipment and stomped off
in the direction of Hay -- a momentary mist-clad apparition accelerating into
fog. We parted company with the other couple and wished
them well, only to encounter a group of
&lt;a href="https://www.dofe.org/"&gt;Duke of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; participants (in the UK we have
something called the "Duke of Edinburgh Award" for teenagers, that encourages
them to explore and encounter nature and outward bound activities). We helped
them with some map reading and then, gazelle like, off they sprang into the
mist leaving us to ponder our ever slowing pace and the fact that, like London
buses, we had met nobody all day only for three different parties to turn up
within minutes of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa3/into_the_valley.jpg" alt="The mist lifted, and we could see the way down into the valley." title="The mist lifted, and we could see the way down into the valley."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The mist lifted, and we could see the way down into the valley.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got to the end of the ridge, the mist lifted and we were able to finally
see some views. Yet these were not to last since we had to make our descent,
and it was here that things got very tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My poor Mary had to endure intolerable pain in her knee as we made our way
down the side of the mountain towards Hay-on-Wye. The first of several steep
descents should have only taken us perhaps 20 minutes but, in fact, took an
hour. We had several more descents to go until we reached our destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet we spied a line of cars parked in the distance, and this proved to be our
way out of the difficult and painful situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was clear the final couple of miles to Hay were all down hill with
difficult conditions under foot. My feet were a constant source of a dull ache,
and if I stopped walking the pain would become strong and resuming the walk
took lots of effort. Mary was clearly in a lot of pain with her knee, and so
our journey was no longer the happy, if tiring, adventure we had enjoyed up
until this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we approached the parked cars I tried a few local taxi companies, but nobody
picked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking we may need to just press on, I spotted one of the cars was occupied.
I tapped on the window to find a man of a similar age to ourselves inside. He
told me he was there just to enjoy the view and to get out of the house for a
while. I explained our situation and he very kindly offered to drop us off in
Hay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, he suddenly remembered, "by the way, I have COVID".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had driven to the beauty spot just to get out of the house since he had been
isolating for the past few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="map-day3" style="height: 400px"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a quick (socially distanced) chat about the potential logistics of the
situation and worked out a way for us to get a lift, but with him masked up
with the addition of a scarf around the lower part of his face, and us sitting
away from him with all the windows of the car open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit, we made the right decision because our speed due to the knee
situation was at a snail's pace and it would have taken several hours to cover
the final two miles into town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, we had a fun chat with Carl (our impromptu driver) and I
think he enjoyed the sense of adventure the situation presented. We were
deposited right outside our guest house in Hay, got to our room and collapsed
into the shower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of hours of rest we had stiffened up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I examined my feet and found they were covered in blisters and Mary's knee was,
to use her words, "shot to pieces".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was clear that our journey to walk Offa's Dyke was coming to an end and we
both felt sad and deeply frustrated by the situation. As Mary put it, "I feel
fine from the right knee up", and I was also in fine fettle from the ankles
up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet we could not continue given our different ailments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, we decided to change plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over dinner in the &lt;a href="https://thegoodpubguide.co.uk/pub/118898/hr3+5df/blue+boar/"&gt;Blue Boar Inn&lt;/a&gt; (excellent food and beer),
we worked out what to do next. We'd booked places to stay along our route,
and we certainly didn't want to abandon our holiday, yet we clearly couldn't
walk to the extent that we would need to, and it was clear our current
situation required us to rest and recover before attempting any further
distance by foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end we decided to transform our holiday from a
"by foot" affair to a touring holiday with a car on hand,
which leads us to day 4's adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="https://booktowntaxi.co.uk/"&gt;booked a taxi&lt;/a&gt; to pick us up at 9am the next
morning and take
us to Hereford station. From there we took a train to Shrewsbury and another
short taxi hop to the village where Mary grew up, her parent's house, and the
place where we'd parked our car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey was uneventful, the highlight being the local taxi driver from
Hay-on-Wye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within seconds of picking us up he had asked us about our
reason for being in the place and Mary reciprocated by asking what living in
such a beautiful place as Hay-on-Wye was like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well", he ruefully started, "there's us, and then there's them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing he had a captive audience for at least the next 45 minutes, he went on
to explain that Hay-on-Wye has a highly stratified population. By "us" he
meant those born and bred in the place scraping a living via a few relatively
menial jobs. By "them" he meant, "city folk who sell up, move here and lord it
all over the place like they're millionaires". This included the owners of
various "lifestyle" shops, coffee houses in the town, and artisanal crafty
places. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hadn't seen that much of Hay-on-Wye so didn't have any evidence to check his
appraisal of the situation. We were sympathetic to
his cause and he was clearly enjoying putting the world to rights. As he
dropped us off he even commented that he'd had a jolly old time getting things
off his chest. Clearly, we were good (captive) listeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we picked up our car, we made our way back into Wales and our place of
rest for the next night: Kington. During the journey we realised we were
passing close by the village where Mary's widowed aunt (who we hadn't seen
since before the pandemic) had settled with her new partner. We called ahead
and made arrangements to drop our stuff off in Kington before joining our
relative for a lovely meal and evening of catching up. It was lovely to see
she was so settled and happy with her new partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, after a good night's sleep and a lovely relaxed breakfast we
decided to drive back to Hay-on-Wye and look around... with both of us being
avid readers, the thought of all the book shops, for which Hay is so famous,
was a real draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, within minutes of our arrival we could see yesterday's taxi driver was
onto something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hay-on-Wye &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; clearly a beautiful place, but had
transmogrified into a sort of unintentional parody of itself. We found shops
full of pointless crap, new age treatment centres that gave the place a smell
of cheap incense, and a faux farmer's market full of "artisans" selling yet
more nick-nak crap (there wasn't an actual farmer in sight).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary's knee was also playing up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite our very gentle pace we ended up in the chemist's shop to buy
a knee support to try to help with the pain. After following directions to the
local public toilets (so Mary could put on the strap under her trousers), our
poor opinion of Hay-on-Wye was cemented by finding the cost of taking a pee
was 30 pence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our experience of Hay is that it's a tourist trap of the worst kind,
with no actual investment in the local community. Just scratching the
surface indicated that most activities involved extracting money from naive
visitors with no sustainable local economy to speak of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We quickly escaped Hay-on-Wye and decided to follow our noses to &lt;a href="https://hergest.co.uk/"&gt;
Hergest Croft gardens&lt;/a&gt;. On the way Mary called the UK's
111 service (our NHS's first point of contact for non-emergency medical
situations). A callback with a physiotherapy nurse was duly arranged, and we
subsequently found ourselves walking in some magnificent spring gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa3/hergest_house.jpg" alt="The house in Hergest Croft gardens." title="The house in Hergest Croft gardens."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The house in Hergest Croft gardens.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are over 70 acres of different types of garden at Hergest Croft, and the
house had a wonderful cafe full of vegetarian food. Our slow and steady
wandering through this place was just the antidote we needed to the plastic
pastoral fakery of Hay-on-Wye and the travails of the previous days walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa3/spring_flowers.jpg" alt="Spring flowers." title="Spring flowers."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Spring flowers.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst exploring the rhubarb patch in the kitchen gardens the phone rang again
and Mary found a park bench to talk to the friendly nurse tasked with triaging
her knee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa3/in_the_garden.jpg" alt="In the kitchen garden." title="In the kitchen garden."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;In the kitchen garden.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cut a long story short, I'm currently typing this in the waiting area of 
Llandrindod Wells hospital's minor injuries unit while Mary is being seen by
a physiotherapy nurse. All told, it has taken around three hours from Mary's
first contact to her receiving treatment for her knee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Waiting in the minor injuries unit at Llandrindod Wells hospital.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll check into this evening's rest-stop and find a good pub for this
evening's meal. Tomorrow will be another day of gentle poddling &lt;em&gt;andante con
spirito&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like real life, our Offa's Dyke journey is turning up all sorts of
unforeseen and challenging situations... yet Mary and I continue to support and
encourage each other as we improvise and adapt to an unforeseen touring
holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My feet are feeling fine today, so perhaps -- assuming the nurse doesn't tell
Mary she needs a new knee (highly unlikely) -- we'll even get some more walking
in before we've finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A few hours later, in our B'n'B for the evening:&lt;/em&gt; After a series of tests,
it turns out that Mary's knee is not permanently injured, but just over-worked,
bruised and thus complaining. The nurse told her she needs to rest it for the
next three days or so, while still keeping it moving so it doesn't stiffen up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I guess we'll be playing it all by ear when it comes to rambling
Offa's Dyke (of which we've already walked almost 60 miles in three days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get the feeling we're not done yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onwards!&lt;/p&gt;

engaging musicians. We wondered what sort of music might be on at the
Queen's Head Inn yesterday evening, and we were pleasantly surprised by the
quality, versatility and mellow tones of the unnamed guitarist shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He played a selection of classic pop music, some of his own compositions and
plenty of folk music. At the end he was joined by two others, a mandolin player
(a mandolinian?) and a soprano saxophonist (who confirmed that the only
difference between a lawn mower and a saxophone, is the fingering). Actually,
joking aside, the sax player was quite virtuosic. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa2/music_night.jpg" alt="Music night at the Queen's Head Inn, Monmouth." title="Music night at the Queen's Head Inn, Monmouth."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Music night at the Queen's Head Inn, Monmouth.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had an unplanned and unexpectedly lovely evening just sitting back and
letting someone else perform a set of toe tapping music in such a friendly and
warm atmosphere (the locals were all pleased to make our acquaintance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a continental breakfast, at which Neil gave us advice about the next pub
at which to eat (and his advice about yesterday evening's Italian restaurant
was spot on), we packed our bags and headed for the high street to stock up
on picnic supplies. As a result, we were relatively late setting off from
Monmouth at 9:30am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, we arrived yesterday by the more welcoming direction of travel.
Because, here's a photo of the Welsh facing gate house / toll booth / fortified
bridge out of which Mary and I left the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa2/gatehouse.jpg" alt="Leaving Monmouth via the gate house bridge." title="Leaving Monmouth via the gate house bridge."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Leaving Monmouth via the gate house bridge.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few miles out of Monmouth were some wooded hills. This, I thought to
myself, would be a repeat of yesterday's wonderful forest walking: at the foot
of the hill I heard a woodpecker and the birds were singing &lt;em&gt;fortissimo con
animato&lt;/em&gt;. Here's a recording of the ambient sounds of the woods at the foot of
the hills... including the odd tapping noise of the distant woodpecker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;audio controls&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://ntoll.org/static/files/woodpecker.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"&gt;
  Your browser does not support the audio tag.
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also took this photo immediately after making the audio recording and have
decided to name this place "woodpecker grove".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa2/woodpecker_grove.jpg" alt="The grove in the woods with the woodpecker." title="The grove in the woods with the woodpecker."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The woodpecker grove.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the hills took a sharp turn in an upwards direction (as hills are wont
to do). It's not so much that the hills were huge, it was just that conditions
under foot were very bad and the path was exceptionally steep. Also, at this
point early in the walk, my boots and ankles had a disagreement and I'm afraid
I suffered the painful consequences. Honestly, how Mary put up with the
constant irritated chuntering coming from my direction, like the sound of a
grumpy steam locomotive, I will never know. But she did, and I was glad she
did, because that steep incline was a struggle for all the wrong reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite the pain, difficulty under foot and exceptional effort needed to
climb up the steep inclines, we eventually reached the top... as Mary kept
insisting we would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met a family resting on the bench, who made encouraging sounds about it
being downhill all the way out of the forest from this point on. We suspected
they were being generous with their encouragement, especially given all the
"bloody backpack" type comments coming from my direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was not, actually, the first time we had encouragement on our walk.
Yesterday evening, just as we were walking over the welcoming, less fortified
bridge into Monmouth, a woman drove past, wound down her window and shouted at
Mary, "you go girl!". At that point in the day, Mary probably had a grim look
of determination on her face as the hotel was in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, our downward route was a mixed experience. Mary's knees decided to
complain, yet we found ourselves surrounded by flowers, the forest and the
sounds of nature. Mary's knees also encouraged us to make many stops
to make a closer examination of the flora and fauna we might see. This common
dog violet being a prime example of Mary's knees' keen interest in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa2/flowers.jpg" alt="Flowers in the woods." title="Flowers in the woods."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Flowers in the woods (a common dog violet).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the ups and downs (literally) of exploring the wooded hills, we felt we
deserved elevenses. And so, once we found a suitable spot (perching on a bridge
over a stream) we soon made short work of some banana Soreen bars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa2/elevenses.jpg" alt="Elevenses, sitting on a bridge over a stream." title="Elevenses, sitting on a bridge over a stream."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Elevenses, sitting on a bridge over a stream.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suitably fuelled up, we pressed on over the rolling countryside (or, as Neil at
the Queen's Head described it, gently undulating farmland) and made good
progress. Especially now that I had intervened in the argument between my boots
and ankles. A quick examination of the lacing situation caused me to reconsider
my options. I realised that the boots were simply too helpful in offering
unneeded support for my ankles. So I just ignored a bunch of hooks on my boots,
that seemed to be causing my discomfort, much to the relief of my ankles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our lunchtime picnic was in the middle of a wonderfully tranquil orchard. We
sat down, took off our boots and just let ourselves relax into the grass. It was
lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa2/orchard.jpg" alt="Lunch time orchard." title="Lunch time orchard."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The orchard in which we had our lunch.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting up a head of steam after lunch took a bit of time, but we managed it.
We also encountered some hills that were less inclined to incline, if you see
what I mean. Actually, they were not too much of a challenge to walk and I,
true to form, fell into my habit of stomping &lt;em&gt;allegro con brio&lt;/em&gt; up such hills
as &lt;strong&gt;I found my rhythm&lt;/strong&gt;. Mary has had to deal with such an enthusiastic
response to hills for over 25 years, and can usually be found a little way
behind me insisting that I slow down and take in the views, dammit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This photo, is a case in point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa2/stomping.jpg" alt="Stomping." title="Stomping."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;When I see a hill, I tend to stomp my way up it, and Mary is VERY patient with me.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, we lamented the various aches and pains we were coming to know and
love. For both of us, mid-afternoon, these took the form of the first, dreaded,
blisters. Yet we pushed on through, despite an enforced detour due to an unsafe
bridge that took us off the Offa's Dyke route. This took us through
several flocks of unamused sheep and lambs. Mary reckons we added at least
another couple of miles to our (14.5 mile) route. I think that's the blisters
talking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we rejoined the route and could see our destination ahead with
tomorrow's challenge, the Brecon Beacons, on the horizon. It was at this point
we realised there had only been four kissing gates on today's route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking over the rolling countryside to the Brecon Beacons (tomorrow's challenge).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This evening, we have a meal booked at a recommended pub. In fact, it's the
only damn pub for miles and miles. Let's see if they've even heard of
vegetarians in this part of Wales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow will be a challenging day. It's going to rain, both of us have
blisters, and it's going to be tough walking up and over the Black
Mountains towards Hay on Wye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the name sounds ominous... surely the Black Mountains belong in Mordor..?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary put a positive spin on things: at least we get to try out our new
waterproof trousers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onwards!&lt;/p&gt;

anniversary in style. Mary suggested we walk
&lt;a href="https://offasdyke.org.uk/"&gt;Offa's Dyke&lt;/a&gt; and I only went ahead and actually
booked it all for a twelve day hike. You see, as a devoted husband, I do as
I am told!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To say we've been looking forward to this with some trepidation is an
understatement. Since early January we've been doing several long practice
walks to ensure our equipment behaves, we understand how to pace ourselves
and feel what long (20 mile or more) walks feel like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And today, the moment came for us to start our walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived by train at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chepstow"&gt;Chepstow&lt;/a&gt;, and
booked into a guest house called, appropriately enough,
&lt;a href="https://thefirsthurdle.co.uk/"&gt;The First Hurdle&lt;/a&gt;. It happened to have an award
winning pizza parlour attached to it, so that was our evening meal sorted.
Afterwards we looked at the map and realised that we'd be walking the first
mile or so to the starting stone, only to have to retrace our steps to within
a short distance of the guest house. Given that day 1 was also the longest day
by quite some distance (19.5 miles) we thought we'd give ourselves a head start
and walk the first mile in the evening, thus saving us some time in the
morning. And so, as the dusk was falling, we trekked south from Chepstow to
the starting stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa1/starting_stone.jpg" alt="The stone in Chepstow, that marks the official start of the Offa's Dyke walk." title="The stone in Chepstow, that marks the official start of the Offa's Dyke walk."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The stone in Chepstow, that marks the official start of the Offa's Dyke walk.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were &lt;em&gt;very excited&lt;/em&gt; to find the stone, look across the Severn estuary and
take in that we were taking our first steps together on a very very long
journey. This was just as we had done so (metaphorically speaking) all those
years ago on the day of our wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa1/at_the_starting_stone.jpg" alt="Proof we made the start." title="Proof we made the start."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Mary and I besides the starting stone.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning, we were met at breakfast with a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_breakfast"&gt;full English&lt;/a&gt; (vegetarian) and
lots of coffee. That seemed to do the trick and put the fire in our bellies.
The helpful waitress took this photo of us, just as we were about to set off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes dear reader, independently of each other we have purchased
pretty much the same GorTex jackets and trousers. We definitely look like
the middle aged "Mr. and Mrs." that we so clearly and unwittingly are. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have on my phone an &lt;a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/"&gt;Ordinance Survey&lt;/a&gt; app
into which I can load pre-planned &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format"&gt;GPX files&lt;/a&gt;
that define our route. I created our GPX routes back in January (based upon the
official "Offa's Dyke" guide - sadly &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offa_of_Mercia"&gt;Offa&lt;/a&gt;
is no longer with us to sign such books), and careful testing during our
training sessions showed the Ordinance Survey app was the clear winner for ease
of use and simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we could have saved ourselves the trouble: a squirrel like
ranger, with a love of acorns had clearly marked our route at every turn.
Actually, because the Offa's Dyke route is designated a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Trails"&gt;National Trail&lt;/a&gt;
(and there are several of these in the UK) an acorn logo is used to tell you you're
on such a long distance footpath, administered and maintained by
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_England"&gt;Natural England&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Resources_Wales"&gt;Natural Resources Wales&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Follow the acorn logo to stay on the route.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another unexpectedly common feature of our walk was the large number of
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissing_gate"&gt;kissing gates&lt;/a&gt;. I always thought
they were so named because, if you were walking with someone, the tradition
when passing through such gates, was to share a kiss. I've just looked at the
Wikipedia page (linked to above), and it appears I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;q&gt;The name comes from the gate merely "kissing" (touching) the inside of the enclosure.&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We counted 34 such gates, and we kissed at each one. I'm not going to tell Mary
that we've got our "kissing gate" story wrong, just to see if she actually
reads this blog post..! I think our reason is far better, and certainly more
appropriate given our 25th wedding anniversary. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa1/kissing_gate.jpg" alt="Lots of kissing gates." title="Lots of kissing gates."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The route contained lots of kissing gates (34 on today's leg, we tried them all).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather was wonderful. We had a crisp April day that was full of sunshine,
but not unbearable heat. Conditions under foot were good and we were treated to
all sorts of wonderful moments where we allowed ourselves to be in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mostly walked three types of terrain: wood, hills and river banks. I think
my favourite was the woodland walking (perhaps because I'm originally from
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherwood_Forest"&gt;Sherwood Forest&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were treated to all sorts of sensory stimulation: the smell of wild garlic,
the fresh April breeze, the sound of the river Wye along whose banks we walked,
and, of course, a lot of birdsong. I made this recording in the woods at the
top of the cliffs that overlook Tintern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;audio controls&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://ntoll.org/static/files/bird.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"&gt;
  Your browser does not support the audio tag.
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking of Tintern... for much of the walk we were following in the august
footsteps of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wordsworth"&gt;William Wordsworth&lt;/a&gt;,
who wrote &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lines_Written_a_Few_Miles_above_Tintern_Abbey"&gt;Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;q&gt;Five years have passed; five summers, with the length&lt;br&gt;
Of five long winters! and again I hear&lt;br&gt;
These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs&lt;br&gt;
With a sweet inland murmur. — Once again&lt;br&gt;
Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs,&lt;br&gt;
Which on a wild secluded scene impress&lt;br&gt;
Thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect&lt;br&gt;
The landscape with the quiet of the sky.&lt;br&gt;
The day is come when I again repose&lt;br&gt;
Here, under this dark sycamore, and view&lt;br&gt;
These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,&lt;br&gt;
Which, at this season, with their unripe fruits,&lt;br&gt;
Among the woods and copses lose themselves,&lt;br&gt;
Nor, with their green and simple hue, disturb&lt;br&gt;
The wild green landscape. Once again I see&lt;br&gt;
These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines&lt;br&gt;
Of sportive wood run wild; these pastoral farms&lt;br&gt;
Green to the very door; and wreathes of smoke&lt;br&gt;
Sent up, in silence, from among the trees,&lt;br&gt;
With some uncertain notice, as might seem,&lt;br&gt;
Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,&lt;br&gt;
Or of some hermit’s cave, where by his fire&lt;br&gt;
The hermit sits alone.&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we are, a few miles above Tintern Abbey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tramped the steep and lofty
cliff, saw plots of cottage ground in the villages below, and carefully found
our way through woods and copses as we travelled over the wild green
landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;The two of us at the top of the cliff above Tintern Abbey (in the background).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we descended into Brockweir we started having thoughts of food. Sadly, there
wasn't the hoped for pub, cafe or other means of nourishment. Brockweir hasn't
a lot going for it apart from the beautiful river Wye and the scenery more than
made up for the lack of food and drink!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was as we walked north along the river bank that today's "incident" took
place. At some point, and we're not sure where or how, Mary dropped her mobile
phone. We had got about 2 miles north of Brockweir when Mary discovered it 
was missing. At this point we put on the hand-brake, did a swift 180°
turn and stomped in completely the wrong direction while regularly phoning
Mary's missing mobile to no avail. After perhaps 1.5 miles the phone was
answered by a friendly lady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure I was easily identified as the husband of the owner of the phone, I
described myself as, "a middle age chap, wearing a TUBA t-shirt, with a heavy
backpack and staff".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She replied that she was heading north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I could see a lady
in the distance talking on a phone. So I mentioned I was furiously waving my
staff above my head and she replied,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oh yes, I see you. I'll be there in 5 minutes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happily, Mary was reunited with her phone, but not after adding 3 miles to our
total for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could say this was the only incident on day 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, our naivete about the culinary qualities of Brockweir meant we didn't have
anywhere to grab lunch. As a result, we drank all our water (which was rather
concerning) and cracked open the emergency supply of chocolate Easter eggs.
(Just writing this down, makes me feel stupid, dear reader.) And so the last
few miles into Redbrook were more of a struggle than they should have been
given our empty tummies and the onset of thirst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, as with our journey through life, we both enjoyed ourselves during the
good times (for instance, walking in the woods), and supported and encouraged
each other when faced with a challenge. I can happily report both Mary and I,
on different occasions, helped the other overcome their moaning. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's Mary, descending into Redbrook with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monmouth"&gt;Monmouth&lt;/a&gt;
in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/offa1/into_wye_valley_and_monmouth.jpg" alt="Into the Wye valley and Monmouth." title="Into the Wye valley and Monmouth."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Into the Wye valley and on towards Monmouth.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happily, Redbrook had a pub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unhappily, we were too late for food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I think I consumed the world's best pint of bitter and packet of
salt and vinegar crisps whilst in that drinking establishment... or at least,
that's how it felt, and after 20 minutes of resting and enjoying our
repast, we creaked back into gear for the final push to Monmouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at the &lt;a href="https://queensheadmonmouth.co.uk/"&gt;Queen's Head Inn&lt;/a&gt; we
were cheerfully greeted by Neil, the publican, who made us feel very welcome
and recommended a fantastic Italian restaurant for our evening meal. I'm not
sure what the waiters made of us, but I think we set some sort of
speed-of-eating record in their restaurant, because we woofed down some
amazing, fresh and locally sourced Italian cuisine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write this post, below us we hear live music from the bar, and Mary and I
will soon descend for a final drink, and listen to the music for a while before
a well deserved sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, here's a map of the route we covered today. We're not quite sure how
far we &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; walked, given the unplanned repeat of the river walk, but we
think we managed somewhere north of 22 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="map-day1" style="height: 400px"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow we head to Llangattock Lingoed, which is, as far as we can tell,
completely in the middle of nowhere. As a result, we've spied a good bakery
in Monmouth and will stock up with picnic provisions for tomorrow and the day
after (which will end in Hay-on-Wye).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onwards! :-)&lt;/p&gt;

this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/static/images/wedding.jpg" alt="Our wedding, 2nd August 1997 at Bourton Manor, Shropshire." title="Our wedding, 2nd August 1997 at Bourton Manor, Shropshire."&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Our wedding, 2nd August 1997 at Bourton Manor, Shropshire.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first encountered Mary late on an autumnal Friday afternoon in the library of
the &lt;a href="https://www.rcm.ac.uk/library/"&gt;Royal College of Music&lt;/a&gt;. Mary and I were
the only two people in the
&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@51.4994838,-0.1770779,2a,75y,272.48h,94.45t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sV2M1OLSwpd3LHD0jlX1_MQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656"&gt;Donaldson Room&lt;/a&gt;,
a study area with large oak desks, and she happened to be sat opposite me. I
think there was an immediate attraction because we kept surreptitiously looking
at each other. When I idly chewed my pen to try to hide that I was really
checking her out, she caught my eye and smiled at me. I involuntarily bit down
on my pen in panicked shyness (I'd been found out!) and split the pen lid while
also chipping the corner of my front tooth. I soon fled in embarrassment.
Later, I felt the roughness where my tooth had chipped and reflected that
it would be a permanent reminder of that pretty girl in the
library. For the rest of my life, when I felt the roughness on my tooth, I'd
ask myself "I wonder who she was?".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn't take long for me to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following Wednesday, just after lunch, (yes, I have all the dates, times
and places recorded in my diary of the time) I returned to the Donaldson Room
with a buddy only to find Mary sat at a desk with her friend and fellow
cellist, Ellen. I sat down at the opposite end of their table (realising I'd
found the pretty girl again) and soon found they were not working on an
academic assignment, but goofing around playing the game of
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)"&gt;hang man&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary had a unique tactic... whereas most people do something sensible like
start with the vowels or other common letters (to help figure out the skeleton
or shape of the word), Mary used the least expected letters. She started games
with "X", followed by "Q", then "W" or "Z".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this hilarious and, after watching her play for a few minutes,
couldn't resist to interrupt and say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    "You really have no idea how to play
hang man, do you?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    "Oh yes I do. I'm just choosing to play it like
this", was her mock-offended response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We struck up a conversation, our friends (bored of our flirting) soon left us
in peace and we spent the afternoon chatting. We talked about all sorts:
science, philosophy, plants, gardens, music, books and many other things. All
too soon Mary noticed the time ~ it was 5pm and we had spent three hours in
deep joyful conversation. Time just flew by, but Mary was late for a rehearsal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll never forget how we parted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    "I'm afraid I'm going to have to go to my rehearsal," she said, "but I'd much rather be talking with you."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the following weeks and months we got to know each other, talked a LOT and
eventually shared our true feelings for each other in the spring. It didn't
take much longer for us both to realise we'd found our life-long soulmate and
by the end of the year we were announcing our engagement. A couple of years
later, only a few weeks after Mary graduated from the RCM, we were married. She
was 22, I was 23 and we've been an "us" ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting Mary was the most important moment in my life. Living life's journey
with Mary has been my life's greatest privilege and full of wonderful moments -
the most important highlights being the arrival and growth of our three
beautiful children, Penelope, Sam and William.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;A serious family selfie from 2018.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate 25 years of sharing our journey through life together, Mary and I
have decided to make another (symbolic) journey together. We're going to walk
over 170 miles, during the Easter holidays, along
&lt;a href="https://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/en_GB/trails/offas-dyke-path/"&gt;Offa's Dyke&lt;/a&gt;,
a 1300 year old earthwork barrier created by Offa, king of the ancient
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercia"&gt;Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia&lt;/a&gt;.
Nobody knows why the dyke was built, but the modern Welsh/English border
roughly follows its path and it passes through some of the most beautiful parts
of Wales and England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll start in the south and walk an average of 15 miles a day,
staying in bed-and-breakfasts or hotels along the way.
It being April we expect fresh showers,
but hope for sun to encourage spring flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're not the first to have had the idea of an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Prologue"&gt;April journey&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whan that Aprille with his shoures soote,&lt;br&gt;
The droghte of March hath perced to the roote,&lt;br&gt;
And bathed every veyne in swich licóur&lt;br&gt;
Of which vertú engendred is the flour;&lt;br&gt;
Whan Zephirus eek with his swete breeth&lt;br&gt;
Inspired hath in every holt and heeth&lt;br&gt;
The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne&lt;br&gt;
Hath in the Ram his halfe cours y-ronne,&lt;br&gt;
And smale foweles maken melodye,&lt;br&gt;
That slepen al the nyght with open ye,&lt;br&gt;
So priketh hem Natúre in hir corages,&lt;br&gt;
Thanne longen folk to goon on pilgrimages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect our adventure to take us 12 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the coming weekends we'll spend our time training by rambling similar
daily distances in the rolling Northamptonshire countryside that surrounds
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towcester"&gt;Towcester&lt;/a&gt;. We'll also
blog each day of the journey as a memento of our progress - we both suspect our
adventure along Offa's Dyke will be something we'll want to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're at a loose end in the weekends before Easter, get in touch, come
visit and share a walk with us as we prepare... we forgot to mention
there are many wonderful pubs on our local rambles, and we'd love to share
their hospitality with any of our friends who happen to be passing by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy new year for 2022 and here's hoping you find fulfilment and flourish over
the coming 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://ntoll.org/article/25-anniversary-plans/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 20:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Chicken chicken chicken</title><link>https://ntoll.org/article/chicken/</link><dc:creator>Nicholas H.Tollervey</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;A large part of my day job involves reading and writing what folks
optimistically call "technical documentation". It's usually about as much
fun as sticking forks in one's eyes, rubbing a cheese grater up and down one's
nose or reading the complete unabridged works of Ayn Rand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happily, there are examples of great technical documentation (the
&lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/"&gt;Django project&lt;/a&gt; immediately springs to
mind, and the wonderful folks at
&lt;a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/"&gt;Write the Docs&lt;/a&gt; do amazing work in this
space). But for every example of great documentation, there are many more
incomprehensible, incomplete or incoherent tomes where knowledge goes to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joking aside, quality is clearly a subjective judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy to make innocuous claims like, "good technical writing is clear,
coherent and engaging; bad documentation is the opposite ~ complicated, chaotic
and opaque". Yet trying to pin down terms like "clear", "coherent" or
"engaging" is a slippery exercise and, ultimately, a matter of personal taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more nuanced approach would say diversity of voices and perspectives is
at play here, and &lt;em&gt;it's important to always keep this in mind&lt;/em&gt;. Every reader
and writer comes to documentation from their own unique point of view and lived
experience. That's why pointing out examples of allegedly poor documentation or
claiming there is a "one true way" to write it is unhelpful. It's disrespectful
of difference, arrogantly presumptuous and there are more supportive and open
minded ways to engage when (inevitable) difficulties arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, feedback that is constructive (offered from a desire to help),
compassionate (aware of another's feelings) and unambigous (specific and
actionable) can highlight
unintended misunderstanding&lt;sup id="chicken-sup"&gt;[&lt;a href="https://ntoll.org/article/chicken/#chicken-edit"&gt;edit&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;. It acknowledges there is a difficulty of some
sort, but does so in a way that encourages writers to reflect, refine and
revise their work. It's also perfectly reasonable for the writer to decline to
change things: perhaps you are not the intended audience, they simply don't
have the time (many docs written for open source projects are created by
volunteers), or they disagree with you and stand by their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let many flowers bloom!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I'm honest, I love to read (even stuff I find difficult or disagreeable ~
like Ayn Rand). It is a connection with others, a source of creative
stimulation and an enlargement of my world. I read because I am curious to
reach out beyond myself and into the lives of others. I love the change and
growth this brings. I also love to write - it is an opportunity for self
reflection, a source of consolation, an invitation to connect, and a rewarding
skill to develop and practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why I write this blog: I enjoy the art of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artistry involved in writing is something to celebrate,
cherish and promote. Sadly, and far too often, a focus on form, structure or
process is held up as the best approach to writing technical documentation.
Artistry, taste or style are hardly mentioned, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most documentation looks like what most people think documentation should look
like. There are good reasons why documentation is often organised in the way
that it is, &lt;em&gt;but to follow these conventions is not enough&lt;/em&gt;. Going through the
motions in a structural sense or following a certain form or process is no
guarantee of "quality" (whatever that might mean).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wonderful and humorous example of this is Doug Zongker's "Chicken chicken
chicken".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally
&lt;a href="https://isotropic.org/papers/chicken.pdf"&gt;created in the form of an academic paper&lt;/a&gt;,
and then delivered in the form of a typical academic conference presentation,
Doug created two parodies that focus on process, form and structure at the
expense of meaningful content:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="video-container"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yL_-1d9OSdk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I love how the audience all sound like chickens because they're laughing so
hard.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug's work got me wondering, would the "chicken" effect work for the tropes
and conventions of a software project? I'm pleased to report
&lt;a href="https://chicken.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;that it does&lt;/a&gt;. It even works
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ntoll/chckn/blob/chicken/chicken.py"&gt;for the source code&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ntoll/chckn"&gt;Git repository&lt;/a&gt; and the
&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/chckn/"&gt;packaging metadata&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "chicken" code highlights what a deeply problematic oversight this
focus on form, structure and process is for technical documentation. Imagine
if teaching the composition of poetry only dealt with structure, rhyme
or rhythm at the expense of meaning, metaphor, story-telling, pacing, symbolism
and expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd end up with limericks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chicken chicken chicken chicken,&lt;br&gt;
Chicken chicken chicken chicken,&lt;br&gt;
    Chicken chicken chick,&lt;br&gt;
    Chicken chicken chick,&lt;br&gt;
Chicken chicken chicken chicken.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why this interest in technical documentation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm in the midst of a writing marathon for some of my personal projects (Mu and
CodeGrades). I'm enjoying the opportunity to reflect upon, and work both inside
and outside, the usual conventions for technical documentation. I can't help
but wonder that process, form and structure are best thought of as the servants
of an authentic expression of thoughts, feelings and values through one's own

am ever disatisfied with my output, it's usually because I've forgotten this

&lt;p&gt;As always with any of my work, I welcome constructive, compassionate and

&lt;p id="chicken-edit"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT (18th Nov 2021):&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you to the
person (who wishes
to remain anonymous) who reached out to point out that, "constructive,
compassionate and unambigous", are also slippery terms. I've added
clarifications in brackets and would especially like to point out that they
embodied the very best of constructive, compassionate and unambiguous
feedback in their correspondence with me. :-)

otherwise uninhabited, Scottish island. Every year, since Mary and I first
became an item, I have returned to the island for an off-the-grid retreat of
rest, recuperation and reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to get onto the island: by boat during high tide, or by
walking over two miles of mudflats at low tide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/island_from_shore.jpg" alt="The island viewed from the mudflats" title="The island viewed from the mudflats"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The island viewed from the mudflats.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renovating the cottage is my in-law's retirement project and, from
time to time, we and other members of the extended family have helped in
various ways (most recently my family and I carried more than 2000 slate tiles
and other roofing material up the hill from the beach so the roof could be
fully restored by a couple of friendly local builders).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a small traditional whitewashed cottage with two bedrooms, a sitting room,
a kitchen and a bathroom. Running water is pumped into cisterns from an ancient
well, there is no electricity except that provided intermittently by a
generator and the bathroom is unplumbed with a compost toilet and wash basin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the cottage an old barn is used for storage and contains a sheltered
outdoor room called the "Breeze Inn". In the garden are various home-made seats
around a campfire, a vegetable plot and, to one side, an improvised "hot tub"
made from a large ancient Victorian bath (what a wonderful view!). A fence
secures the property from the island's only other occupants: a herd of sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're free to roam and, while the island is not very big, it offers a
remarkable number of &lt;em&gt;things to do&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/island_mudflats_looking_back.jpg" alt="Looking back towards the mainland from the mudflats" title="Looking back towards the mainland from the mudflats"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Looking back towards the mainland from the mudflats.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;em&gt;thing to do&lt;/em&gt;, as always, is to get to the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year we walked the mudflats and carried our clothes, sleeping bags and a
generous number of books in rucksacks. This has always felt to me like a ritual
of transformation: by crossing the mud we're leaving the real world and all its
interruptions, demands and busy-ness and arriving in a sanctuary of calm, a
refuge for reflection and an undisturbed natural space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking the mudflats allows me to exercise more than just my legs. My senses
are stimulated too. The short walk from the car park to the slipway is along a
verdant tree-lined dappled road. We're accompanied by the distant laughter of
gulls, the piping of oyster catchers and bubbling whistle of curlews. The air
is full of the smell of sweet honeysuckle with an undercurrent of the salty
twang of seaweed. Once barefoot on the mudflats, walking is a warm, wet,
rhythmic sensation that feels like a gentle massage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we sing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often we just lose ourselves in silent reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels important to take in this liminal time: a threshold and transitory
in-between space for adjusting to and from island life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/island_sky_in_water_on_mudflats.jpg" alt="The sky reflected in the water on the mudflats" title="The sky reflected in the water on the mudflats"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The sky reflected in the water on the mudflats.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mudflats are not only (literally) a place of reflection, but also an active
and dynamic world. Birds swoop in to explore the gifts swept in by the tide and
we're not the only ones making journeys: if you look closely, winkles make
tracks over a lunar like landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows where they're off to..?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/island_mudflat_journeys.jpg" alt="We're not the only ones journeying on the mudflats" title="We're not the only ones journeying on the mudflats"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;We're not the only ones journeying on the mudflats.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the mudflats is a long mussel bed called the "rack". Sliding into
sandals protects feet from the sharp rocks and mussels that crackle and pop 
when trodden on. To the west of the rack are some medieval fish pools
constructed by monks from a nearby abbey. Apparently they used the island as a
hermitage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the tide is in and the rack is submerged, we're isolated from the mainland
and alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/island_rack.jpg" alt="The partially submerged mussel bed called the rack" title="The partially submerged mussel bed called the rack"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The partially submerged mussel bed called the rack.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tide and other natural rhythms of the place soon influence the pace of
life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change of the tide is a barely perceptible but constant reminder
that, as Heraclitus would put it, "everything flows" (πάντα ῥεῖ). Yet, while
the tide is a rhythmic constant, each tide brings about a new world:
new flotsam and jetsam emerge from the waves, the sea itself changes colour,
tone and mood, and the shallow river on the mudflats changes course. Once again
Heraclitus provides a suitably watery aphorism, "on those who enter the same
rivers, ever different waters flow" (ποταμοῖσι τοῖσιν αὐτοῖσιν ἐμβαίνουσιν
ἕτερα καὶ ἕτερα ὕδατα ἐπιρρεῖ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a steady tempo of change in the external world leaves time and space to
feel and observe changes within, reflect and simply be with oneself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help with this process I switch off my mobile phone and don't wear a watch ~
preferring to synchronise myself with the world through the ambient events of
island life: passing boats, swimming in the sea, playing games, exploration of
the island, reading and, of course, the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The island has a microclimate. It might be raining torrents on the mainland,
but the island is still bathed in sunshine. The sky is often a turbulent and
dramatic looking place and another source of steady rhythmic change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often we're richly rewarded simply by looking up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/island_double_rainbow.jpg" alt="A double rainbow over the cottage" title="A double rainbow over the cottage"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A double rainbow over the cottage.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the sunrise and sunset always act as momentous cadences in the day.
Everything feels like it is paying attention during these marvellous
transitions. Memories of these times act as souvenirs to help recall the
feeling of being on the island (especially when frustrated by life back on the
mainland).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/island_sunset.jpg" alt="Sunset over the mainland" title="Sunset over the mainland"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Sunset over the mainland.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of the hill, directly below the cottage is a sandy beach. We
often swim there when the sea makes it safe to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a prominent sign in the cottage's kitchen declares, "by the sea, all worries
wash away", and swimming in the sea is another way of immersing oneself in
nature. It's certainly very cold, but this soon passes and you become sensitive
to swells and waves while paying close attention to the depth or closeness of
jellyfish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it doesn't really matter how you occupy yourself on the island. As
my father-in-law commented, "only the seagulls are here to complain, so don't
worry". I'd add that seagulls always sound as if they're complaining, so it
becomes very easy to ignore them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/island_beach.jpg" alt="The beach" title="The beach"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The beach.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shore around the island is another source of stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many years, and allegedly within living memory, the island was used by
smugglers. There are many caves of various sizes and some of the larger ones
even have shelves cut into the rock. They also make wonderful hiding places for
games of hide-and-seek with younger members of the family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the caves are not just a hiding place for children. Birds, bats and even
the odd marten have been observed to emerge from their depths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/island_cave.jpg" alt="A view from one of the many caves" title="A view from one of the many caves"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A view from one of the many caves.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The microcosms that are rock pools are another source of fascination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the time to observe them requires patience but is often rewarded. A
large lumbering human being who casts a shadow inevitably causes the creatures
in such pools to skedaddle. But quiet repose results in the gradual emergence
of the inhabitants and life resumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a sort of people watching, but in the wholly alien world of plump red
anemones filtering whatever floats by, crabs scuttling around the place as if
they're late for an important office meeting, the ponderously peripatetic
quests of the many different sized winkles and the nervous darting of small
fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I stand up and make my presence known, it's as if the inhabitants of the
pools are playing Grandmother's Footsteps (as we do back in the cottage
garden)... everything suddenly stops, statue like, as if nobody wants to be
noticed making a move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/island_rockpool.jpg" alt="A typical rock pool" title="A typical rock pool"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A typical rock pool.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rocky intertidal zone is also full of hidden treasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closer to the sea one finds all sorts of interesting smelling seaweed and I
often wonder (but always forget to try) if these fruits of the sea are edible
and suitable for cooking. When I once mentioned this to the elderly fisherman
who used to be the lighthouse keeper on the island, he told me the only use
he'd have for the seaweed was as compost for his garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rocks and pebbles are an endless source of interest. Often it's fun to
play target practice and throw or skim stones. Other times one finds pebbles
that have been polished in such a way that an interesting shape or colour is
revealed. Sometimes we find strange flotsam or jetsam stuck in the rocks: wood
collected for the fire, a deflated football, bones from a sheep, an old trainer
or a dead gull are typical finds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flinty smell of the rocks, the sounds of birds and waves as well as the
need to retain balance while carefully jumping from rock to rock mean there's a
certain amount of relaxed stimulation and attention required to navigate this
zone of the island - itself a rather wonderful state of mind to inhabit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/island_rocks.jpg" alt="The rocky intertidal zone" title="The rocky intertidal zone"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The rocky intertidal zone.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be remiss of me not to mention the island's most surprising
inhabitant: an elephant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/island_elephant.jpg" alt="The elephant" title="The elephant"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The elephant.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be able to make out Mary at the end of the elephant's trunk, and I
hope you get a sense of the size and scale of this wonderful mossy mammoth.
Many a time has been spent imagining ourselves as Scottish mahouts (McHouts?)
journeying out of the sea on the back of such a craggy beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elephant is also a favourite location for clues during many of the riddle
based treasure hunts we play with younger members of the family...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
My backside is washed twice a day,&lt;br&gt;
With my tail playing in the spray,&lt;br&gt;
  It's certainly not junk,&lt;br&gt;
  Hiding at the end of my trunk,&lt;br&gt;
Could it be a clue? Yes! Hooray!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that our own children are older I'm pleased to say the island still retains
its magic for them. Projects, games and exploration are the order of the day.
It's a special place for all of us (which makes it all the more special,
because it is a shared specialness private to our family).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are on the island last week, along with our long suffering, faithful
and ever patient dog, Burt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images"&gt;The Treachery of Images&lt;/a&gt;
by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Magritte"&gt;René Magritte&lt;/a&gt; is a
thought provoking visual brain twist. It shows a pipe, under which is written
in French, "this is not a pipe". Magritte is correct, it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a pipe, but
actually a painting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/treachery_of_images.jpg" alt="This is not a painting"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lacma.org/art/exhibition/magritte-and-contemporary-art-treachery-images" target="_blank"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; - educational fair use.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, you're not currently looking at a painting ~ rather, you're
looking at a multitude of pixels, each one acting like a small tile in a huge
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_mosaic"&gt;mosaic&lt;/a&gt; containing millions of
tesserae, each tile being one of many millions of possible colours. If you were
to zoom into the image you'd see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="This is still not a painting" src="https://ntoll.org/images/treachery_of_zoom.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, you're not even looking at an assortment of tessellated pixels! Rather,
your screen actually consists of repeating cells, each in turn split
into red, green and blue (RGB) sections. If you used a magnifying glass
to look at your screen, you'd see something similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/treachery_of_pixels.jpg" alt="This is definitely not a painting"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LCD_pixels_on_Acer_Extensa_5620Z_20090124.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; - Licensed under &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en" target="_blank"&gt;CC BY-SA 3.0&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upper half of the image contains blocks of the RGB cells arranged to
display the basic colours: red, green and blue. The lower half contains RGB
cells arranged into two blocks for white and black. By adjusting the amount
of constituent red, green and blue emitted in each individual RGB cell, many
millions of colours can be generated. If you step back from your screen,
squint your eyes and look at the blocks of colour you'll see this effect in
action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For completeness, here's a close-up of one of the individual RGB cells:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="An RGB square pixel" src="https://ntoll.org/images/rgb_pixel.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are likely to be several hundred of these minute electrical components
per square-inch of the screen you're using to read this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our perception of what we encounter depends on its scale. Furthermore, what
we
encounter may not be what we see, as René Magritte forces us to acknowledge
with The Treachery of Images (we see a pipe when we're actually encountering a
painting, or pixels, or a screen, and so on). There is a
&lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/" target="_blank"&gt;phenomenological&lt;/a&gt;
aspect to our relationship to things: we can't help but add meaning coloured by
our unique experience of the world. We have a unique and personal
perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This applies to other encounters with the world too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our perception of time depends on a sense of scale or, perhaps more
accurately, tempo. Each of the following eight images shows a different
snapshot of a stick man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/running_frames.png" alt="Individual frames for a running stick figure animation"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href="https://steemit.com/art/@magiccleatus/magiccleatus-animates-2d-running-stickman-an-animated-template" target="_blank"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; - educational fair use.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet if we repeatedly and speedily place them on top of each other, we no longer
see eight individual images, but a single image &lt;strong&gt;in motion&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, because
we can't help but add meaning, we see a stick man running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Running stick man animation" src="https://ntoll.org/images/running.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scale also effects other senses, such as our perception of sound. Consider the
following musical experiment:
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._9_(Beethoven)"&gt;Beethoven's mighty 9th Symphony&lt;/a&gt;
stretched to last twenty-four hours. By drastically slowing down the tempo (all
other aspects of the piece remaining the same ~ notes, instrumentation, and so
on), it becomes something completely different. It sounds like an ambient
musical experiment by the likes of
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno"&gt;Brian Eno&lt;/a&gt; and our recognition of
melody, form or harmonic structure disintegrates - even though the original
melody, form and harmonic structures are still present. Such a temporal zoom,
as well as hiding aspects of the music, also reveals new details: I find myself
concentrating on the timbre of the instruments and enjoying the indistinct
transitions between pitches ~ it's like listening through fog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="video-container"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/?listType=playlist&amp;amp;list=PLpJJnhgdCvERiUvfCaVjD0TC8y45MErN5" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are these examples important..?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first post I challenged you to acquire new perspectives about seemingly
everyday things. I called these brain twists because they cause "aha" moments.
Such subjective shifts provide a new, and hopefully deeper, understanding of
what we're encountering or how we relate to something. The external world
remains as it was before, but it is we who have changed perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the previous examples show brain twists are something we do naturally,
even if we're not always aware we're performing such twists. These examples
were carefully chosen because they bring such &lt;em&gt;changes of perspective into
focus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put simply, I'm inviting you to shift &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; perspective about how &lt;em&gt;we change&lt;/em&gt;
perspective. Or, put another way, can you "brain twist" brain twists..?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our capacity to shift perspective due to scale is a fundamental reason &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;
computers appear to work. They work so fast at such a small scale that our
sense of time and space means we don't see our computer re-drawing a static
image on a flat screen made up of millions of RGB cells at a rate of around 64
images per second. Rather, we see this blog post consisting of words, images,
sound and video - things that are meaningful to us. The computer is working at
a completely different scale of time (3 billion instructions a second), space
(running on microscopic electrical components) and with an absence of meaning
(it's just physics relating to electrical circuits). Yet you understand the
words, appreciate the images and engage with the music in this blog post: you
bring your unique culturally informed and meaningful perspective to the human
scale of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the brain twist: such tricks of perspective due to scale &lt;em&gt;also apply to
thinking&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider learning to ride a bike ~ it's a challenge because the learner has to
think about lots of different things at once. For instance, turning the pedals,
steering, keeping balance, posture, the brakes and coordinating all these
things together so the beginner cyclist moves safely in the right direction.
When we become proficient at cycling, this bundle of thinking simply becomes
"riding a bike". All the constituent aspects I describe above are subsumed into
a larger concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such diverse dexterous details, through careful practice and familiarity,
become a single named activity. In a sense, we have zoomed out in the scale of
our thinking. Such generalisations are useful as placeholders in further
thoughts... the building blocks of our generalised thinking are at a
&lt;em&gt;different scale&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, I could say "I'm just going to cycle to the shops, do you want me
to get anything for you?". The concept of &lt;em&gt;cycling to the shops&lt;/em&gt; is a place
holder for the rather complicated activity of riding a bike, but whose specific
details are not important for the meaning of the sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, in a computing sense, what we mean by "abstraction".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense of "abstraction", functional units that fulfil a certain role are
organised into larger, or are composed of yet smaller, functional units. Such
units are used together to achieve some valuable end when their relative scale
allows complementary usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because computers process billions of instructions a second, this hierarchy of
abstraction is hidden in the blink of an eye with the end result being
something comprehensible at our human scale (except when things go wrong and
the computer becomes incomprehensible or appears confused...  commonly known as
a bug).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often the skill of the programmer or engineer is to work out the arrangement
and coordination of such abstractions to achieve something meaningful at the
human scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wonderful visual example of such an arrangement and coordination of
abstraction is
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life" target="_blank"&gt;Conway's Game of Life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Game of Life is an automata: rules that define a process for how certain
states of affairs transition to a new state (sound familiar?). In the case of
the Game of Life, the states of affairs describe a huge grid. Each square cell
in the grid can be alive (white) or dead (black). Another way to imagine the
Game of Life is as many parallel tapes lined up on a huge Turing machine with
some squares white (on) and others black (off).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only three rules to work out the next state of affairs, and they are
disarmingly simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead
   cells stay dead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels as if nothing of much interest could be made with such a game. But
consider the following Game of Life grid state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="tape life"&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By following the simple rules, the next state of affairs &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; look like
this (pick a white cell from the first grid, follow the rules in your head, and
work out if you agree with this second grid):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="tape life"&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this grid can transition to a further new state of affairs (notice
anything interesting? It's an upside-down version of the first grid, but moved
one cell to the left and one cell up):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="tape life"&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next state of affairs is, unsurprisingly, the same as the second state but
upside down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="tape life"&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further outcome of such mirroring is that this final state &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; transition
back to the first state of affairs but moved by one cell to the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such an arrangement and coordination of cells, combined with the rules of
the Game of Life, create a looping pattern of four steps that always moves in a
single direction until it bumps into another pattern of cells. It appears to
humans as if something is flying across the grid of squares (which is why this
pattern is called
&lt;a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Spaceship" target="_blank"&gt;a
spaceship&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skilful combination and arrangement of such small groups of cells in the Game
of Life show how abstraction, scale and perspective interact. In the following
video, as the camera zooms out the tempo of change speeds up to reveal
structures within structures, and something rather amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="video-container"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ra14IjqXS1Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar stack of abstraction is required for you to read this blog post
on &lt;em&gt;your computer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My website is created using an easy-to-read-and-write programming language
called &lt;a href="https://python.org" target="_blank"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;. Python is,
itself, written in another programming language called
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" target="_blank"&gt;C&lt;/a&gt;.
C is less easy to read but still comprehensible to a trained software engineer.
Yet C has to be
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler" target="_blank"&gt;compiled&lt;/a&gt;
for it to work. When C code is compiled, the relatively understandable C code
is translated into instructions written in
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language" target="_blank"&gt;assembly language&lt;/a&gt;,
that work in a way that is closer to how the circuitry of the computer works.
But we're not finished yet..! The assembly language is itself translated into
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code" target="_blank"&gt;machine code&lt;/a&gt;,
a representation of assembly language instructions as binary numbers. This is
the lowest level software engineers tend to go when it comes to zooming-in to
the computer. But the numeric machine code instructions physically stored on
the computer hardware are usually further refined into
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcode" target="_blank"&gt;microcode&lt;/a&gt;
- a series of circuit-level instructions that describe how the hardware should
behave to complete the computation. Of course, someone will have organised and
designed the millions of transistors and other microscopic components that make
up the (&lt;a href="https://ntoll.org/article/why-computers-4/"&gt;Turing complete&lt;/a&gt;) hardware. This
is the level of computing at which electrical engineers, chip designers and,
ultimately, physicists can be found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, I didn't have to write everything from scratch. Coders use
&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/" target="_blank"&gt;software libraries&lt;/a&gt; in the same
way a chef may re-use pre-existing recipes. Someone else will have figured out
how to do some valuable task and organised the steps needed to fulfil it into,
say, &lt;a href="https://arrr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank"&gt;a module
of re-usable Python code&lt;/a&gt;. Just like the bundle of thinking needed
to ride a bike becomes subsumed into the concept of cycling, I don't have to
know the implementation details, but can refer to the relevant re-usable code
when it is needed in my own program. Such re-use of existing instructions
happens in all the levels of the computing &lt;em&gt;stack&lt;/em&gt; I describe above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these levels of abstraction are required to get to this fragment of Python:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hello World in Python" src="https://ntoll.org/images/hello_world.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I come to the end of this exploration of computing, I can't help but feel
there is one final brain twist ~ something missing or yet undiscovered about
our relationship with computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use a musical metaphor, I feel like I've explained why a piano works (the
tuning, acoustic properties, action of the keyboard and hammers) and shown why
this relates to musical theory. Yet I've said nothing about the art or
performance of music, the emotions we feel when we hear or play music, or
that music moves us at a fundamental and human level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are missing the "music" of computers (and we miss it at our peril).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wittgenstein best sums up my feeling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Menschen, die immerfort ›warum‹ fragen, sind wie die Touristen, die, im
&lt;a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baedeker-Reisef%C3%BChrer"&gt;Bädeker&lt;/a&gt; lesend,
vor einem Gebäude stehen &amp;amp; durch das Lesen der Entstehungsgeschichte etc etc
daran gehindert werden, das Gebäude zu &lt;em&gt;sehen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(People who are constantly asking 'why' are like tourists, who stand in front
of a building, reading &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baedeker"&gt;Baedeker&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;amp;
through reading about the history of the building's construction etc etc are
prevented from &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ Ludwig Wittgenstein, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_and_Value"&gt;Culture and Value&lt;/a&gt; (MS 124:93)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should, rightly, be amazed by the technical marvel of computers; but it
is all too easy to be overwhelmed by, and focus on, the apparent cleverness (or
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine" target="_blank"&gt;Rube Goldberg&lt;/a&gt;-iness)
of it all. Sadly, in so doing we miss the opportunity for an enlarged, more
creative and expressive encounter with computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computers are not just machines for rapidly evaluating logical instructions.
They are a medium through which we share and express our values, culture,
social world and forms of life. They are only valuable because we are able to
create and express things of significance &lt;em&gt;through computers&lt;/em&gt;. Furthermore,
&lt;em&gt;the way we express things with computers&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;that we choose this form of
expression&lt;/em&gt; is also of cultural significance. Like other forms of creative 
endeavour, computers reflect those who make, inhabit and consume in such a
medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers shine when they enlarge us in an affirmative, fulfilling, humane,
creative and expressive way. Yet computing for the sake of computers, with no
regard for culture, is a diminished, inhumane and insular form of ignorance
and, sadly, I can't help but feel disappointed with how, in the mainstream, we
currently use and think of computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media is anything but social... it's an efficient advertising laboratory
that turns humanity into lab rats caged in echo chambers of digitally digested
packets of small-mindedness. "Artificial intelligence", "machine learning",
"blockchain" and other such buzzwords are nerdy PR for the clever use of
computers to unsatisfactorily automate human activity (including our latent
prejudices). Computer games are mostly beautiful looking yet formulaic
variations on a theme, target driven and hardly allow a player to express
themselves. Our world is polluted by complicated and unpleasant computerised
gizmos: "intelligent" washing machines, programmable coffee makers, automatic
point-of-sale machines... most of which are banal or frustrating to use. And,
of course, no aspect of life is too small to be "solved" by an app available on
your mobile device (a perculiarly problematic outlook ~ it's as if we're all
broken and need technology to fix us).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a shallow, invasive and unfulfilling world of computing is perhaps
inevitable. It reflects our failure to think creatively while we focus on
automating things in the most trivial, complicated or inconvenient manner. Yet
highlighting such a problematic state of affairs is helpful, for then we can
compensate and re-balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I can't help but feel the missing part of our relationship with
computers is an emphasis on things like culture, contemplation and creativity ~
activities and aspects of our lives that are affirmative, healing, empowering,
raise up our existence or provoke useful reflection and personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final brain twist I have for you is to rise above a merely technical view
of computers. I hope you imagine, create and participate in a meaningful,
authentic and engaging culture expressed with and through computers. One in
which computers become a medium for
&lt;a href="https://democracyclub.org.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;affirmative&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://freedom.press/" target="_blank"&gt;liberating&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href="http://inbflat.net/" target="_blank"&gt;expressive&lt;/a&gt;
activities that enlarge ourselves, our world and our place in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, let's &lt;a href="https://ntoll.org/article/on-being-together"&gt;together&lt;/a&gt; compose the
oft-missing "music" of computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, we are &lt;a href="https://ntoll.org/article/thought-in-motion/"&gt;only just getting started&lt;/a&gt; with
these strange instruments of automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://ntoll.org/article/why-computers-5/"&gt;part 5&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows isn't so much a brain twist, as an extended make-pretend that
points the way to what a computer is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a strange looking contraption sitting before you on a table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It consists of an exceptionally long reel-to-reel tape that passes through an
electro-mechanical device of some sort. The tape is subdivided into square
"frames". Some of the squares contain symbols, others are empty. As it
operates, the tape moves through the device both to the left or to the right,
like a badly behaved cinema projector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/turing_machine.jpg" alt="A Turing Machine"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Turing_Machine_Model_Davey_2012.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;
  - Licensed under
  &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en" target="_blank"&gt;CC BY 3.0&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "head" (where the tape passes through the device) covers exactly one
square's worth of the tape. There's a flash of light from the head when a new
square is completely contained therein. Sometimes this is followed by a
clicking sound. When the click is heard the symbol in the square is changed:
it's either different or completely rubbed out. Then the tape moves to the left
or right to a new square before continuing its strange flashing and clicking
operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the front of the machine is a little window. The window is labelled
"&lt;code&gt;STATE&lt;/code&gt;" and contains a number that changes when each square is "processed" by
the head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while the machine comes to a stop. The state window contains the number
0 (zero). By the head, on the tape, are a sequence of squares containing some
familiar looking symbols:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="tape"&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;H&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;L&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;L&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt;
            &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;W&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;L&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two other objects are on the table. On one side of the contraption is a black
and white photograph of a thoughtful looking man with an old fashioned side
parting and &lt;em&gt;enigmatic&lt;/em&gt; smile, sitting in a sturdy deck chair. On the other is
a thick ring-bound pile of paper whose title you can just make out:
"Instructions".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructions listed on the front page consist of just four rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set the machine to state "1".&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the symbol in the current frame on the tape.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Given the current state of the machine and the symbol read from the
  current frame, look up what to do next. "What to do next" is defined by three
  transitions:

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Change to a new numbered state.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Replace or delete the symbol in the current frame.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Move the tape by some number of frames to the left or the right.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the new state is "0" then stop, otherwise resume from rule 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the many pages that follow is a single huge table entitled "What to do
next". It contains thousands of entries under the same five columns, and all
look something like these extracts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;CURRENT STATE&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;HEAD READ&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;➔&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;NEXT STATE&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;HEAD WRITE&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;MOVE TAPE&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;"A"&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;785&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;"5"&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;1L&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;516&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;" "&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;657&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;"!"&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;86R&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;516&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;"#"&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;657&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;"!"&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;86R&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;1023&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;"#"&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;1020&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;" "&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;23R&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A note, just above the table, explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each combination of the "CURRENT STATE" and "HEAD READ" values is unique.
There is one row for each possible combination. Identify the row that
corresponds to the current state of affairs. The new state of affairs is
defined by the "NEXT STATE", "HEAD WRITE" and "MOVE TAPE" values on the same
row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the first line of the extract means that if the machine is in state
&lt;em&gt;1&lt;/em&gt; and the head reads the symbol &lt;em&gt;"A"&lt;/em&gt; then the next state is &lt;em&gt;785&lt;/em&gt;, the
symbol &lt;em&gt;"5"&lt;/em&gt; should be written to the current square, and the tape should
move &lt;em&gt;1 square to the left&lt;/em&gt;. The final line of the extract means that if the
machine is in state &lt;em&gt;1023&lt;/em&gt; and the head reads the symbol &lt;em&gt;"#"&lt;/em&gt; then the next
state is &lt;em&gt;1020&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;symbol should be deleted from the current square&lt;/em&gt; and
the tape should move &lt;em&gt;23 squares to the right&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is propositional logic..!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a table of conditionals whose two premises (the "CURRENT STATE" and
"HEAD READ" values) are conjuncted (logical &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt;) to identify what the
resulting behaviour should be (the "NEXT STATE", "HEAD WRITE", and "MOVE TAPE"
values). &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt; the state is &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt; the value read by the head is &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;code&gt;THEN&lt;/code&gt; go to the specified &lt;em&gt;next state&lt;/em&gt;, write &lt;em&gt;such-and-such&lt;/em&gt; to the tape and
move the tape by &lt;em&gt;however many squares in a certain direction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look carefully, hidden within the extract are also disjunctions (logical
&lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt;). The middle two lines (for state &lt;em&gt;516&lt;/em&gt;) have the same state and outcome,
but different symbols read from the head. This is the same as checking &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt;
(the state is &lt;em&gt;516&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt; the head reading is &lt;em&gt;empty&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt; (the state is &lt;em&gt;516&lt;/em&gt;
AND the head reading is &lt;em&gt;"#"&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;code&gt;THEN&lt;/code&gt; the next state is &lt;em&gt;657&lt;/em&gt;, write &lt;em&gt;"!"&lt;/em&gt; to
the tape and the tape should move &lt;em&gt;86 squares to the right&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is the purpose of this machine? What does it do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It follows the four rules, that start the instruction manual, to repeatedly
perform the logical steps defined in the "What to do next" table. The steps in
the table react to and change the state of the symbols on the tape in order
to arrive at a desired end result. What that end result is depends upon what's
on the tape when the machine is switched on and how the steps in the table
interact with that starting state and subsequent states of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, given a certain "what to do next" table, a starting state and
some input on the tape, it computes a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;strong&gt;a computer!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had the instructions, a copy of the table, a physical tape, a pencil and
an eraser you might follow the rules from the start state (state &lt;em&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;) until the
end state (state &lt;em&gt;0&lt;/em&gt;) was achieved. But the machine would do it much faster and
wouldn't get tired, bored or make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A cardboard computer" src="https://ntoll.org/images/cardboard_computer.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process might feel familiar: deliberately precise rules describe how,
given certain states of affairs, such and such things must happen. States of
affairs unambiguously describe how things are in the world. For example, "the
machine is in state 284 and the current square on the tape contains an &lt;code&gt;H&lt;/code&gt;".
When I say that such and such must happen, I mean clear and unambiguous
instructions describe how the machine proceeds given a certain state of
affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how I described the game of Snap &lt;a href="https://ntoll.org/article/why-computers-1#rules_of_snap"&gt;in the first article&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that computing a result is not that different to playing a
children's game. Computing a result is the same as following a set of
instructions for changing states of affairs. Such unambiguous instructions
are called &lt;em&gt;algorithms&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the rules in the "what to do next" table are logical, they can be 
represented by the sorts of electrical circuitry described
&lt;a href="https://ntoll.org/article/why-computers-3"&gt;in the previous post&lt;/a&gt;. Such circuitry receives input
signals from the components in the head, and controls other components such as
the motors that control the tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this machine to do anything meaningful, someone will have carefully
crafted the "what to do next" rules so the symbols on the tape when the machine
is switched on in state 1, are transformed into a completely-new-yet-useful
set of symbols when the machine achieves state 0. The algorithm is defined by
the "what to do next" rules written in the table and encoded in the
circuitry. The machine transitions from state 1 and what may be found on the
tape at that moment, via a huge number of intervening states, to state 0 and a
computed result written on the tape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I've described is a Turing machine. Such an imaginary device was invented
by the British mathematician Alan Turing (the chap in the photograph). It turns
out that anything that can be computed by a set of instructions that manipulate
symbols (the algorithm), can be computed by a Turing machine. Anything that
works in a way that is equivalent to a Turing machine is described as Turing
complete because it, too, is able to compute outcomes from an algorithm. To be
Turing complete is to be a programmable computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turing
&lt;a href="https://londmathsoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230" target="_blank"&gt;explained how computation works&lt;/a&gt;
by describing his machine. If you create something that can work like a Turing
machine then you have also created a computer. You don't have to prove your
computer is complete, because Turing already did that for you. This equivalence
of capability is &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we learn about Turing machines: they make it
clear what it is to be a computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many variations on a Turing machine. The one I've described could be
simplified in a couple of ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The machine could use multiple tapes with multiple heads rather than a
   single tape and a single head. The information used to make a computation
   is available in concurrent squares on several tapes, rather than as a
   sequence of individual values on one single tape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The alphabet of symbols that could be written to or read from the tape
   need only consist of two symbols: one representing "on", and the other
   representing "off". Put simply, information is represented in a binary
   fashion as shown in the following illustration (white or "1" is on, black or
   "0" is off).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;table class="tape"&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="on"&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these changes wouldn't make the machine any more powerful than the one
I've described, but they may make the machine easier to build and program. The
important property of the machine is its Turing completeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer you're using to read this article obviously works in a completely
different way to the seemingly ramshackle contraption I describe. While there
is no tape or head inside your computing device, there are transistors
etched into silicon chips that react to and change the state of values stored
in memory, billions of times a second. The chips connect to other parts of your
device via input/output pins. The other parts of your device, connected via
specialist hardware, might include things like a screen, keyboard, mouse,
speaker or microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a Turing machine iterates over the same cycle of reading from the head,
writing to the tape and transitioning to a new state, a silicon based chip,
synchronised by a clock, carries out a similar iterative cycle of work one
instruction after another. In fact, the clock speed of your machine's CPU tells
you how many instructions the chip will carry out each second (for instance, a
3Ghz chip will manage 3 billion instructions a second).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in how an actual chip behaves,
&lt;a href="http://www.visual6502.org/sim/varm/armgl.html" target="_blank"&gt;this
link takes you to a simulation of an ARM1 chip&lt;/a&gt; -- a forerunner to those
that run your mobile phone. Click on the "play" button
(&lt;img src="https://ntoll.org/images/play.png" target="_blank" style="display: inline;vertical-align: middle;"&gt;)
to watch the chip "operate". It's possible to zoom in and out, move around,
speed up or slow down the clock and see how individual transistors are
connected to and interact with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a computer is simply something that is Turing complete, why is it that we're
able to use such devices to read and write words, hear music, draw pictures,
watch videos and all the other meaningful stuff for which we find computers so
useful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer relates to how we perceive things, our talent for abstraction and
our cultural context. The next and final post will explore these concepts.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://ntoll.org/article/why-computers-4/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 07:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
