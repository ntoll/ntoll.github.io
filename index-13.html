<blockquote>
"Scientia potentia est." (Knowledge is power.)
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon">Sir Francis Bacon</a>.</p>
<p>In the digital world knowledge is stored, in its latent form, as data in
databases. Everyone from your local
<a href="http://www.tesco.com/clubcard/clubcard/">supermarket</a> to the
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/">government</a> collects data about <em>all of
us</em>. Information and knowledge is extracted about all aspects of
our lives, from our shopping habits to whether we've paid our taxes (it is no
accident that the examples above relate to extracting money from us). According
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/04/schmidt-data/"> to Google</a> it
currently takes just two days for us to generate as much information as was
created by all of humanity from the dawn of time until 2003.</p>

<p>This article is about data and databases - the technology that makes the
accumulation and analysis of this flood of information possible. It starts with
a simple question: what is data?</p>

<p>"Data" are values that convey meaningful information about something.
Meaning is implied by the context and structure of the data. Structure is
formed from the way data is represented. Databases simply store and provide
mechanisms for working with structured data.</p>

<p>The most fundamental data-related act is to name a value:</p>

<p></p>
<pre><code class="python">my_name = "Nicholas Tollervey"</code></pre>

<p>My name <em>is</em> Nicholas Tollervey. This is shown by
"<code>my_name</code>" being assigned the value "<em>Nicholas Tollervey</em>".
Assignment happens when a <em>token name</em> is followed by an <em>equals
</em> sign that is, in turn, followed by a <em>value</em>. Notice the three
layers: meaning, structure and representation.</p>

<p>Another example:</p>

<p></p>
<pre><code class="python">nicholas = {
    "first_name": "Nicholas",
    "middle_name": "Harry",
    "surname": "Tollervey",
    "birthday": {
        "year": 1973,
        "month": 8,
        "day": 19
    }
    "height": 180,
    "weight": 76.9
}</code></pre>

<p>After reading the above I'm certain you'll know when to send me a birthday
card. Something called <code>nicholas</code> has a single value associated with
it: an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array">associative
array</a>. Associative arrays are <em>key / value</em> pairs - like a
dictionary of words or a subject index at the back of a book. In this case it
has six entries, one of which is itself a nested associative array with three
entries. It's an associative array because it is enclosed by
curly braces and contains a list of <code>"key_name": value</code> pairs
separated by commas. The associative array is assigned to <code>nicholas</code>
in exactly the same way as the first example (<em>token name</em> followed by
<em>equals</em> followed by <em>value</em>).</p>

<p>Incidentally, I can retrieve my data like this:</p>

<p></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; my_name
"Nicholas Tollervey"
&gt;&gt;&gt; nicholas["height"]
180</code></pre>

<p>(This example uses the <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>
programming language: I type in commands after the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
prompt and the Python interpreter replies on the new line.)</p>

<p>A final example:</p>

<table>
<caption>People</caption>
    <tr>
<th>id</th>
        <th>first_name</th>
        <th>middle_name</th>
        <th>surname</th>
        <th>nationality_id</th>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
        <td>Nicholas</td>
        <td>Harry</td>
        <td>Tollervey</td>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
        <td>Terry</td>
        <td>Charles Oliver</td>
        <td>Jones</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
        <td>Esteve</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>Fernandez</td>
        <td>3</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<table>
<caption>Nationalities</caption>
    <tr>
<th>id</th>
        <th>name</th>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
        <td>Australian</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
        <td>British</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
        <td>Spanish</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>Obviously, I'm British and my buddies
<a href="https://twitter.com/terrycojones">Terry</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/esteve">Esteve</a> are
Australian and Spanish (respectively). You know this because you understand how
to read tabular information and spot the relationship between the values in the
<code>nationality_id</code> column of the <em>People</em> table and the values
in the <code>id</code> column of the <em>Nationalities</em> table. You know
it's tabular information because it's a two dimensional grid with the
vertical columns indicating named fields and horizontal rows representing
individual records. Once again: meaning, structure, representation.</p>

<p>Each example is more complex than the one preceding it. The first is a
single key / value pair (where <code>my_name</code> is the key and
"<em>Nicholas Tollervey</em>" is the value), the second is a key
(<code>nicholas</code>) associated with a value that is itself key / value
pairs (the associative array). Finally, the third example contains rows of
items that all share the same keys (a.k.a. columns) but different values. Each
type of record (people, nationalities etc) has its own table.</p>

<p>How do such meaningful data structures / representations relate to
databases?</p>

<p>There are four basic actions that all databases may perform on data:
<em>create</em>, <em>read</em>, <em>update</em> and <em>delete</em> (often
expressed as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>).
There are many types of database that meet this minimum functionality. The
three data examples illustrate the types of data structure stored in three of
the most popular types of database: key / value stores (such as
<a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> or
<a href="http://www.memcached.org/">Memcached</a>), document oriented databases
(like <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> or
<a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a>) and relational databases
(for example, <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a> or
<a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>).</p>

<p>Key / value databases are, at heart, associative arrays. They provide three
basic actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assign a value to a key (both creating and updating).</li>
    <li>Read a value associated with a known key.</li>
    <li>Delete a value using a known key.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such simple databases are extremely fast and well suited for tasks where
speed is of the essence. However, there isn't a simple way to search the stored
values and keys must be known before being used to retrieve or delete
associated values. Nevertheless, they are extremely useful as caches of
arbitrary values. If you want to try such a database you should visit the
<a href="http://try.redis.io/">try redis tutorial</a> tutorial ~ a gentle yet
comprehensive tour of a popular key / value store.</p>

<p>Document oriented databases store arbitrarily structured documents
expressed as associative arrays. Every document has a unique ID created by the
database and used as a key to reference the document.</p>

<p>However, documents are not opaque values as in key / value databases.
Rather, it is possible to <em>reach in to the documents</em> and construct
queries that reference the document's named attributes (keys). For example,
given a <em>people</em> database I could create a query to retrieve all
documents that have a <em>height</em> attribute with a value greater or equal
to 180.  Since the structure of the documents is arbitrary, such queries rely
on conventions (all <em>people</em> documents have a <em>height</em> attribute
whose value is expressed in centimetres).</p>

<p>Because document structure is not fixed (except by convention), new fields
can be added at any time and document oriented databases specify default
handling for missing fields - usually they'll evaluate to <code>null</code>
(unknown).</p>

<p>To play with a document oriented database, explore the MongoDB
tutorial on the project's
<a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">homepage</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database">Relational
databases</a> developed from the work of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.F._Codd">Edgar Codd</a>. They store
data in rows
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple">tuples</a>) that share the same
columns
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_(computing)">attributes</a>)
defined in tables
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_(database)">relations</a>) -
bracketed words are the formal terminology for the colloquially named
concepts. Each row contains a special field called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Key">primary key</a> (the
<code>id</code> column in the example) that uniquely identifies the record.
Tables, representing different sorts of things, are related to each other with
special fields called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key">foreign keys</a> that
reference primary keys of rows in different tables (the
<code>nationality_id</code>). Many relational databases also enforce
constraints such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_integrity">referential
integrity</a> - where foreign keys may not refer to non-existent primary
keys.</p>

<p>To work efficiently, data in relational databases should be
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization">normalised</a>
to avoid duplication. Data need only be stored in one table
representing a specific type of thing. Therefore, modifications only happen
once and are propagated via the relationships between tables. For example, the
<em>nationalities</em> table is the only place where nationalities may be
defined. Tables for things with nationalities (such as <em>people</em>) need
only reference the single <em>nationalities</em> table via a foreign key rather
than duplicate such information. The process of normalisation usually has
three steps of increasing efficiency:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_normal_form">first</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_normal_form">second</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form">third</a> normal
forms. Sometimes it is necessary to de-normalise a database for performance
reasons - it's faster to retrieve a single row than it is to retrieve several
related rows from different tables.</p>

<p>Structured Query Language
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>) is the programming
language used by relational databases to work with data. Based upon
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra">relational
algebra</a>, it provides CRUD functionality and capabilities for
specifying the structure and relationships between data. It's easy to create
powerful queries:</p>

<p></p>
<pre><code class="sql">SELECT people.first_name, people.surname, nationalities.name
FROM people
JOIN nationalities ON nationalities.id = people.nationality_id
WHERE people.surname = "Jones"</code></pre>

<p>The result of which is:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>people.first_name</th>
        <th>people.surname</th>
        <th>nationalities.name</th>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Terry</td>
        <td>Jones</td>
        <td>Australian</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>The query asks: give me the first name, surname and nationality (line 1) of
people whose surname is "Jones" (line 4). We have to specify where to collect
this data (line 2) and how to join the related tables together (line 3). Notice
that SQL doesn't specify how to run the query but describes what the expected
result should be.</p>

<p>Interactions with a database happen as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction">transactions</a>.
Transactions can contain many different commands and should have several
desirable properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Atomicity</em> - transactions are an all-or-nothing affair that
    cannot be abandoned in an incomplete state.</li>
    <li>
<em>Consistency</em> - transactions fail if they attempt to
    put the database in to an invalid state such as breaking referential
    integrity or some other constraint.</li>
    <li>
<em>Isolation</em> - each transaction is independent of and cannot
    interfere with any of the others.</li>
    <li>
<em>Durability</em> - once complete a transaction's effect will
    remain despite catastrophic events like power failure, crashes or
    errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>A database is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">ACID</a> compliant if its
transactions meet these standards.</p>

<p>The pace of change in data-based technology is fast. Relatively recent
trends, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data">big
data</a> (huge data sets and the technology needed to manage them), deserve
their own article. Yet, even the technology described above allows
companies and governments to build frighteningly accurate pictures of our
lives (how do you think Amazon is able to make such useful suggestions?).</p>

<p>Personally, I find the ubiquitous analysis and measurement of our behaviour
inadvertently Orwellian. Furthermore, there is a tendency to trust the results
obtained from databases without recognizing the <em>meaning</em> level of
data relies on interpretation (of which there are many varieties).
Nevertheless, there are great opportunities to do good and I am reminded of the
Buddhist proverb,</p>

<blockquote>
"To every man is given the key to the gates of heaven; the same key opens the
gates of hell."
</blockquote>

<p>I hope we choose the right gate.</p>

<p>This is a personal reflection on programming: the creation and curation of
instructions that make computers do things. Instructions (also known as
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code">source code</a>" or just
"code") are organised into
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program">programs</a> (or
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a>") that fulfil
specific tasks. People who write programs are called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer">programmers</a>,
developers, software engineers or (colloquially)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(term)">hackers</a>.</p>

<p><img src="static/images/code.png" alt="code"></p>

<p>Instructions are expressed in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">programming languages</a>
that make it easier for humans to comprehend what is going on. So-called "high
level" languages are easier for humans to work with than "low level" languages
that express things in a way that is closer to how the computer works. In
all cases programs are transformed from the original programming language into
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code">binary
instructions</a> that cause the computer to function in a particular way.
This transformation can happen in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>The program is "compiled" in to binary instructions by a special
    program called a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiler</a>. The result
    is an "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable">executable</a>"
    run by the end user.</li>
    <li>The program is "interpreted" by an <em>executable</em>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)">interpreter</a>
    whose function is to act as a sort of on-the-fly translator of the
    instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both mechanisms have strengths and weaknesses. Because compiled programs
have already been transformed in to the computer's binary instructions they
are often much faster than interpreted programs where such
transformations happen as the program is running. Yet interpreted programs
offer the flexibility of adapting and changing themselves while they are run by
the interpreter which makes it easier to solve certain sorts of programming
problem. Sometimes a combination of these techniques is used:
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">JIT</a>
compiler will interpret until certain sets of instructions are
obviously more frequently used, at which point <em>only the popular sets of
instructions</em> get compiled "just in time" to make them faster.</p>

<p>Sometimes programs work as expected and produce valuable results. More often
they do not. The failure to make a computer work usefully is called a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_bug">bug</a>.
There are generally two sorts of bug: the wrong outcome is correctly
implemented (the design is wrong) or the expected outcome is wrongly
implemented (the instructions are wrong). In any case, because computers are
complex machines, making them do something useful is surprisingly hard.</p>

<p>Managing and taming complexity is one of the core tasks of a programmer. A
common piece of advice given to junior developers is
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_it_simple_stupid">kiss</a>"
(keep it simple, stupid!), for there are fewer things that could go wrong. As
computing pioneer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare">Tony
Hoare</a> explains,</p>

<blockquote>"There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is
to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other
way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The
first method is far more difficult."</blockquote>

<p>Personally, I think creating simple and useful software is more like
writing succinct yet powerful prose than opaque logical wizardry. This has
an important side effect: simple and coherent code is easy to understand. Code
that is easy to understand is easy to maintain. Maintaining code is the act of
fixing bugs and curating instructions so things work efficiently (also known
as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">re-factoring</a>).
In this way a program is easy to improve as bugs are found and new features
implemented.</p>

<p>Some languages have been created with the explicit aim of making code
easy to read and understand (such as <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>).
Some developers promote certain development styles that they claim encourages
programmers to produce high quality software. A classic example of this is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test driven
development</a> where developers write a failing test encapsulating a feature
of their program before actually implementing the feature itself to make the
test eventually pass. Others (such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a>)
promote a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate style of
programming</a> where code is interspersed with natural language explanations
that tell the "story" of the code.</p>

<p>Another core skill of a programmer is de-constructing and analysing
problems. Often the problem is expressed in a
vague and open-ended way and it is the task of the developer to precisely
constrain the scope of the problem so they create some
useful outcome. A personal example, from my first programming class, illustrates
this beautifully: my tutor explained that programs were merely instructions
and that we had five minutes to provide instructions telling him how to switch
on the classroom's lights. How hard could it be to write such
instructions? Take a minute to imagine what <em>you</em> would write (you
may assume that the person following them knows about directions, actions and
names of things).</p>

<p>I can still remember my list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stand up.</li>
    <li>Look around until you locate the light switch.</li>
    <li>Walk in the direction of the switch.</li>
    <li>Press the switch with your fingers.</li>
    <li>Retrace your steps.</li>
    <li>Sit down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, I failed miserably. My tutor pointed out that he was already
stood up, there were desks between him and the light switch and the damn lights
were already on anyway.</p>

<p>Time and resources are also essential elements of software development:</p>

<p>First, the developer needs to have a feel of how best to organise a
program. This means analysing their implementation of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithm</a> (the
instructions at a conceptual level) to ensure that it is both timely and makes
efficient use of resources like the computer's memory and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cpu">CPU</a>. Often
this is expressed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">big-O</a> notation.</p>

<p>Second, programming usually involves a deadline. Customers need to know how
much time it will take to finish software given a certain number of developers
and some sort of collaborative development process. I've heard this described
as "the cat herding problem". Fred Brooks
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">famously observed</a>
that adding developers to a struggling project only slows it down further.
Furthermore, clients change their minds mid-project (in addition to providing
vague problems like the one mentioned above) and there are always
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns">unknown
unknowns</a> that add unforeseen time and effort to the project. If this were
not enough, how do you coordinate teams of programmers who are all working on
the same software?  It's like trying to get ten people to co-compose a symphony
<em>at the same time</em>.</p>

<p>Happily, developers have created methods and tools to help them work
together. Small autonomous
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile</a>"
teams are preferred over large managed cohorts of developers.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue_tracking_system">Issue tracking
systems</a> make it easy for clients to request and prioritise features,
report bugs and give developers a clear audit trail upon which to base
development decisions. Code is stored in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control">version control
systems</a> that allow developers to track each other's changes and
resolve any conflicts in the software (for example, when two people edit the
same piece of code). In fact, developers have become so good at this sort of
thing that others borrow these tools and techniques: lawyers have been known to
collaborate on complex legal documents with a version control system.</p>

<p>Finally, programming is a political activity: making software
means defining the laws that dictate how the digital world should be. Often
this obvious fact is left unacknowledged. However, incumbent interests affected
by the rise of digital culture (for example, the so-called "creative"
industries represented by organisations such as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA">RIAA</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPAA">MPAA</a> and their ilk)
have attempted, with some success, to change the law to limit the use of file
sharing software used to distribute pirated content.</p>

<p>Yet, programmers have turned the law to their advantage.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a>,
founder of the <a href="http://fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> (FSF),
became disillusioned with locked down dis-empowering software so set out
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw">four essential
freedoms</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).</li>
    <li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does
    your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a
    precondition for this.</li>
    <li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor
    (freedom 2).</li>
    <li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others
    (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to
    benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for
    this.</li>
</ul>
<p>These freedoms are enshrined in the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl">General Public License</a> (GPL) -
a license that subverts copyright (that seeks to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved">expand the rights
of creators</a> at the expense of the rights of others) in to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">copy<em>left</em></a> (that
seeks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reversed">expand the
rights</a> of everyone). There is one important exception that limits
everyone: any modifications to source code covered by the GPL must also be
freely available under the GPL. While the GPL has been described as
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/the-commie-smear-against-open-source/946">communist</a> and
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/">cancerous</a>
it is not anti-commerce and (I think intentionally) does not mention any
political affiliations. Code covered by the GPL can be sold (see sections
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl#section10">10</a> and
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl#section11">11</a>). It's how the FSF
first raised money for their cause.</p>

<p>There's a sentiment gaining in popularity:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imV3pPIUy1k">program, or be
programmed</a>. If you would like to learn to program, there are
<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/tutorials/programming-basics">plenty</a> of
<a href="https://www.udacity.com/courses">resources</a> available
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/category/cs-programming">online</a>.

    <p>This evening I attended another friendly
<a href="http://northackton.stdin.co.uk/blog/">Northackton</a> meeting (my
local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace">hackerspace</a>). It
was great to see so many people turn out for a "build your own marble machine"
workshop. I took along two of my kids to join in the fun: Penelope
(11) and Sam (8).</p>

<p>As with the previous
<a href="article/northackton-useless-machine">useless machine</a> workshop we
were joined by friend-of-Northackton and maker-extraordinaire
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/msraynsford/">Martin Raynsford</a>
who has set himself the task of providing 365 laser cut items in 365 days. He
provided us with a nifty
<a href="http://msraynsford.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/project-7-marble-machine-1.html">marble machine</a>
~ a laser cut wooden mechanism that's easy to assemble with just a craft
knife, wood glue and a screw driver. If you email Martin he'll supply the
necessary files for you to cut your own mechanism or will sell you the pre-cut
kits that we were using. Furthermore, his blog is definitely worth a read and
packed full of all sorts of interesting projects (the
<a href="http://msraynsford.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/lizard-spiral.html">Escher Lizards</a>
particularly caught my eye).</p>

<p>Both Penelope and Sam had a great time to the extent that Penelope was
trying to work out how she could attend again despite having a string
orchestra rehearsal on Monday evenings.</p>

<p>Here's Sam demonstrating the contraption we built together:</p>

<p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vsFu_dt73tY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>I love how he's so engrossed in tweaking the spiral and chute (especially at
the end of the clip). Penelope was also rather distracted by last minute
adjustments to her solo effort:</p>

<p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/t6LKPgWuel4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Why don't schools make use of such fun, easy-to-build and interesting
models? It certainly beats the plastic key ring I "made" over six weeks when I
was at school.</p>

    <p>(As with all "<a href="article/concise-and-simple">concise and simple</a>"
articles I assume no prior knowledge of the subject and keep the length to
less than 1500 words.)</p>

<p>What is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aret%C4%93">best way</a>
to organise diverse entities co-existing together in large dynamic groups? How
are such arrangements created? Who is responsible for making things work?</p>

<p>These are important questions in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_philosophy">political philosophy</a>
and
<a href="article/internet-concise-and-simple">Internet</a> engineering and
show that both subjects, at an abstract level, share much in common.
From a political perspective the first question can be answered with
different forms of government, the second by investigating concepts like
justice, rights and law while the third question concerns the role of power
and authority. From a technological perspective the first question concerns
"architecture" (how computational resources fit together), the second is
answered by process, requirements and design while the third question concerns
capability, roles, standards and (again) authority.</p>

<p>This post concerns
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">peer to peer</a>
(P2P) architecture ~ where peers of
equal status (devices running appropriate software) cooperate in a loose
decentralised network for mutual benefit. Peer to peer is the antithesis of
hierarchy - where some have elevated status and power over others. The image
below illustrates how this changes the way devices connect and communicate. The
peer to peer network on the left is simply a collection of devices (in blue)
with different numbers of connections between them (in grey). The right hand
image is the classic client (blue) / server (red) hierarchy where many
clients rely on a single server to fulfil their functionality.</p>

<p><img src="static/images/topology.png" alt="p2p v client/server topology"></p>

<p>Sometimes it is important to have hierarchy: it is best that a consultant
surgeon is in charge of an operation rather than a well-meaning democracy of
volunteers. In an ideal world, hierarchy is best when the obvious skill,
knowledge and capabilities of an entity are acknowledged to bring about
greater benefit for all. In an ideal world, those with elevated status and
authority would have earned it via reliable and consistent public displays of
such skill, knowledge and capabilities. In an ideal world, the responsibility
and trust associated with status and authority would be a serious yet welcome
obligation. Unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal world and hierarchy is
often the cause of much that is bad and frustrating.</p>

<p>Some technologies, such as
<a href="article/the-web-concise-and-simple">the web</a>,
are hierarchical and inadvertently introduce leverage points used to
exploit or gain power over users. The web has a <em>client/server</em>
architecture where information and the capabilities to change information
are firmly within the realm of the server (the website). The client, using a
browser, has to request the server deliver information <em>to them</em> and
make changes <em>for them</em>. Unfortunately, user's data is often stored and
delivered in a way that makes it hard to migrate between services. Personal
data is analyzed by websites and sold via targeted advertising or (worse)
handed to governments and other third parties without explicit consent.
Disruption ensues when websites break: there's no way to get important
documents if the server is down. The client/server model is centralisation of
power and websites are single points of failure.</p>

<p>Contrast the web with peer to peer architecture where the loose and
decentralised organisation of computing resources make it <em>very hard for
third parties to control</em> users. This simple idea can be illustrated
by two popular yet different peer to peer systems:
<a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/">Bittorrent</a> (for sharing
large digital assets such as audio and video files) and
<a href="http://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> (a decentralised digital
currency).</p>

<p>For Bittorrent, Bitcoin and many other peer to peer systems the three
questions I asked at the start can be answered thus:</p>

<ol>
<li>The most effective way to organise a diverse and dynamic group of
    participants is with peer to peer architecture (this can be for both
    technical and political reasons).</li>
    <li>The means of creating such a network is via an open protocol describing
    the expected behaviour of participants (including checks to ensure
    correctness).</li>
    <li>It is the participant's responsibility that they correctly implement
    the protocol in order to make the system function correctly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bittorrent is an incredibly efficient way to share large files <em>because
of</em> its peer to peer architecture. Imagine that you wanted me to copy
a paper edition of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace">War and Peace</a>.
I'd probably photocopy and give you every page in order. It's how
large files are usually downloaded: linearly from server to client.
Unfortunately, if I were busy or, worse still, had lost my
original you wouldn't get a copy. Bittorrent works differently: it's better if
I told you who else had a copy so you could ask them to provide <em>different
pieces</em> of the original that you then collated. This is faster because your
peers share the work concurrently. Furthermore, if one of the peers failed to
deliver their piece you'd notice it was missing and request it from another.
Therefore, there is no single point of failure. Finally, if someone else wanted
a copy then <em>you</em> could provide pieces even if you'd not yet received
the complete work. As a result peers <em>give as well as take</em> value from
the network.</p>

<p>In reality, users download a "torrent" file containing details of the
resource they're interested in and who to ask for it. They become a node on the
bittorrent network and request pieces from the identified peers. As
clients download and re-assemble the pieces of the file, others on the network
request pieces in turn. Thus, it takes a relatively short time
for large files to be delivered. Furthermore, popular files spread around the
network and become easier to deliver since there are more peers to provide
pieces.</p>

<p> Some websites (most famously the
<a href="http://thepiratebay.se/">PirateBay</a>) collect torrent files and
provide search facilities. Other sites, called "trackers", monitor which peers
have what files - although more recent versions of bittorrent
allow peers to do this themselves. The video below, made by the
creators of bittorrent, provides a good summary:</p>

<p><iframe width="420" height="236" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NYTvTPrgSiM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>The superior performance,
<a href="http://www.ipoque.com/sites/default/files/mediafiles/documents/internet-study-2008-2009.pdf">huge</a>
<a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/intl/es/company/about/ces_2012_150m_users">number</a> of
<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1714001/bittorrent-has-more-users-netflix-and-hulu-combined-and-doubled">users</a>
and uncontrollable availability of pirated content
has led the incumbent "creative" industry to disrupt illegal sharing
through legal, economic and political means (for example, the PirateBay is
censored within the UK). This is
<a href="http://tpb.piraten.lu/">easier said than done</a> and in no way
changes the effectiveness of the Bittorrent network itself. Users quickly find
<a href="http://www.ichi.co.uk/post/22269260925/bypassing-the-uk-pirate-bay-blocks-via-proxies-mirrors">other means</a> of finding torrent files.</p>

<p>Bittorrent uses a peer to peer architecture because it is the best technical
solution. The legal, economic and political fallout emerged later. In contrast,
Bitcoin had political and economic motivations from the start and peer to peer
enables such ends.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency based upon an
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_specification">open protocol</a>.
Unlike regular currency, controlled by banks and governments, Bitcoin is
designed to have <em>no central issuing authority and instead relies on the
machinations of the protocol to regulate balances, transactions and the issuing
of currency</em>. Like cash, transactions can be anonymous. Bitcoins can be
subdivided into 100-million smaller units called "satoshis" and, at the time of
writing, one bitcoin is worth just over
<a href="http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxGBP">£8.82</a>.</p>

<p>Transactions reference Bitcoin addresses created by the potential recipient.
A Bitcoin user can have many Bitcoin addresses and may even decide to use one
address per transaction. They simply identify the recipient:</p>

<p></p>
<pre><code>1HcrwtLrbe97aRBD5KCn5izumXp8N7nXcS</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes they are displayed as QR-codes to be scanned by mobile
phones: </p>

<p><img src="static/images/bitcoin-address.png" alt="A bitcoin address"></p>

<p>Assuming a positive balance you can transfer bitcoins to me using the
Bitcoin address above (you can't have a negative Bitcoin balance). Your
Bitcoin software publishes and
<a href="article/public-key-crypto-concise-and-simple">cryptographically
signs</a> the details of the transaction and peers check and verify the
details before adding it to a set of recent transactions called a "block".
Blocks are distributed around the network so balances and transfers
are tracked to avoid double spending. The protocol is designed so attackers
would need impossibly large amounts of time and computing power in order
to subvert the chain of blocks tracking transactions.</p>

<p>New Bitcoins are "discovered" by peers on the network as a reward for
solving the computationally hard problem that is part of the process for
creating new transaction blocks. The difficulty of the problem is adjusted by
the protocol to ensure that bitcoins are issued at a consistent rate. This
process is called "mining" and the supply of bitcoins will never exceed 21
million. When this limit is reached miner's efforts will be rewarded with a
small transaction fee. The video below explains Bitcoin from an end user's
perspective:</p>

<p><iframe width="420" height="236" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Um63OQz3bjo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Bitcoin is complex and many details have been hidden in my explanation.
However, it is an open and audited technology and hundreds of thousands of
people trust it enough to use it every day.</p>

<p>Concerns have been raised about tax-avoidance, anonymous payment for illegal
goods and fraud via the use of Bitcoin but this also applies to traditional
currencies. Ultimately, the peer to peer nature of Bitcoin is the mechanism for
liberating users from the interference of banks and governments. It remains to
be seen if Bitcoin will become popular and disrupt the financial system in the
same way that Bittorrent has done with content delivery.</p>

<p>Peer to peer systems challenge the status-quo with a decentralising power
shift. Furthermore, creating such technology is far easier and more effective
than traditional means of political change.</p>

<p>The World Wide Web (or just "the web") is a global hypertext
system invented by <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Sir Tim
Berners-Lee</a> in 1989. The web is <strong>not</strong>
<a href="article/internet-concise-and-simple">the Internet</a>. Rather, it
is an application that sends messages via the Internet. You're using it
now!</p>

<p><img src="static/images/internet.png" alt="A map of the Internet"></p>

<p>Hypertext is <em>the</em> core concept of the web: pages
containing text and other media reference each other via so-called
hyperlinks. In this way, pages connect to form a nebulous web of
relationships. Hypertext was coined in the 1960s by
<a href="http://ted.hyperland.com/">Ted Nelson</a> although the basic concept
dates back to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush">Vannevar Bush's</a> 1945
article,
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/?single_page=true">As We May Think</a>
where he describes an intriguing device called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">Memex</a>
(MEMory indEX). Various pre-web hypertext systems were developed in the 1960s,
70s and 80s, but it was only until the early 1990s that Berners-Lee's version
of hypertext became popular.</p>

<p>The web is made with these concepts:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page">Page</a> - a document
    on the web. Web pages can contain text, images, sound, video and forms
    (to facilitate limited interactivity).</li>

    <li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">Hyperlink</a> -
    something in a page that, when activated, takes the user
    to another page on the web. Often abbreviated to "link".</li>

    <li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url">URL</a> - a uniform
    resource location identifies a page or other resource on the web.</li>

    <li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">Browser</a> -
    software on the user's computer that downloads web pages, displays them
    and handles user interactions (such as filling in a form or clicking a
    link).</li>

    <li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">Server</a> -
    a device on the Internet that runs software to deliver web pages and other
    resources to browsers.</li>

    <li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP">HTTP</a> - HyperText
    Transfer Protocol describes how browsers and servers interact.</li>

    <li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> - HyperText
    Markup Language defines the structure of web pages identifying such things
    as paragraphs, links and headings.</li>

    <li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>
    - Cascading Style Sheets describe how a page should look by defining
    layout, colour scheme, typesetting and other presentation information.</li>

    <li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript">Javascript</a> -
    a ubiquitous programming language for browsers. It defines the behaviour
    of a page beyond the basics of clicking links or submitting forms.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the early days of the web HTML was the only way to create pages (CSS
and Javascript were later developments). The essence of HTML has not changed
over the years:</p>

<p>HTML is written as a series of <em>elements</em>. Elements are defined with
named <em>tags</em> between less-than (&lt;) and greater-than
(&gt;) symbols. The scope of an element is defined by an opening and
closing tag. For example, a heading is defined by the
<code>h1</code> element:</p>

<p></p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;h1&gt;Hello&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>

<p>The closing tag is just like the opening one apart from the prepended
back-slash (/). The tags are a balanced pair: the scope
of the heading element is defined as the text "Hello" and displayed as:</p>

<h1>Hello</h1>

<p>Elements can contain other elements but are not allowed to overlap:</p>

<p></p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;p&gt;this is &lt;strong&gt;valid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

<p>but,</p>

<p></p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;p&gt;this is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code></pre>

<p>HTML has a certain structure: two elements, <code>head</code> and
<code>body</code>, are contained within an <code>html</code> element.
Information about the document is expressed by elements within the
<code>head</code> tags. Elements within the <code>body</code>
tags define the structure of the page. For example:</p>

<p></p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/styles.css"/&gt;
    &lt;meta name="author" content="Nicholas H.Tollervey"/&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is some text enclosed within a paragraph tag.
    I can link to &lt;a href="http://ntoll.org/"&gt;other docs&lt;/a&gt;
    using an anchor tag.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

<p>HTML is currently at version five (HTML5). Actually, HTML5 is
a collection of standards. Some add capabilities for embedding media while
others add new tags. HTML5 colloquially refers to specifications for new
browser behaviour too, such as local data storage.</p>

<p>Browsers were originally simple and merely text based applications, as
shown in the screenshot below. Despite these shortcomings the structure of the
page is very clear and easy to read (hyperlinks are green).</p>

<p><img src="static/images/lynx.png" alt="Old skool web"></p>

<p>The web "happens" in two places: the client's browser and the website's
server.</p>

<p>Clicking a link or typing in a URL makes your browser send a request
over the Internet using HTTP (as
<a href="article/internet-concise-and-simple">described here</a>).
The server identified within the URL responds with HTML for the web page, CSS
describing how to display it and any Javascript needed for the page to function
correctly.</p>

<p>Before rendering the page to the screen the browser transforms the HTML
in to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">document object
model</a> (DOM). The DOM is a data structure used to match HTML elements
with CSS rules. Furthermore, snippets of Javascript run at certain points
in the page's existence and manipulate the DOM as events occur (such
as when the page finishes loading, a button is clicked or a form is
submitted).</p>

<p>As you interact with the browser it repeats this process to fetch new pages
from the websites you visit. Sometimes your browser <em>posts</em> information
back to a website (when you fill in a form). The website responds
with a page that reflects the information you submitted.</p>

<p>This happens within the realm of your "client" computer. However, an
equally interesting story happens on the server.</p>

<p>In the simplest case web pages are static so the server responds with
pre-existing content. However, many websites are dynamic and allow you to
change them on-the-fly. For example, as you browse a shopping website you may
click buttons that add items to a virtual shopping basket. If you visit the
web page that represents your basket you expect it to be up-to-date and list
the correct number of items.</p>

<p>For this to happen several things must be in place.</p>

<p><em>The server should know who you are</em>. You are authenticated in
some way, usually with a username and secret password, and authorised to
interact with certain pages. For example, only you should be able to view and
change your settings. Furthermore, the server must not confuse you with other
users, so your interaction with the website is associated with a unique
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_(computer_science)">session</a>
linked to your identity so the server can track who is making requests.</p>

<p><em>The server should keep track of state</em>. When you add an item to a
shopping cart this should be reflected in the way the website behaves. Such
state is stored in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> "backend".</p>

<p><em>The HTML should reflect the state stored in the database</em>. This is
achieved with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor">templates</a>:
snippets of HTML combined with data specific to the client.
Rendering templates to HTML is "frontend".
The following snippet is for a simple shopping basket (anything enclosed
within <code>{% raw %}{% %}{% endraw %}</code> is replaced):</p>

<p></p>
<pre><code class="html">{% raw %}&lt;h1&gt;Hi, {% user.username %}!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your shopping cart contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
{% for item in user.cart %}
  &lt;li&gt;{{item.name}} - {{item.description}}&lt;/li&gt;
{% endfor %}{% endraw %}
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><em>The server should be reliable</em>. Between the front and back ends
is a <em>logic</em> layer checking requests, interacting
with the database and ensuring the correct HTML is served. This needs to work
correctly (imagine if, when clicking a "buy this item" button, a
website added two items rather than one).</p>

<p><em>The server should perform well</em>. A website should quickly
handle a great many requests at once. Two common ways to achieve good
performance are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)">caching</a> (store
and re-use things that take time to compute but don't change that much over
time) and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)">load
balancing</a> (route incoming calls to a pool of servers so the
workload is shared). Popular websites consist of many servers
handling specific tasks (such as the database, rendering templates or
the logic) hidden behind layers of load balancers and caches.</p>

<p>If this sounds complicated, that's because it is. However, the description
given above is a simplification of the amazing engineering that takes place
to display a web page on your screen.</p>

<p>However, all is not well.</p>

<p>Browsers implement web-standards in different ways:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer">Internet Explorer</a>
is famous for getting things wrong. HTML and CSS are more complex
with each revision - gone are the days of a beautifully simple hypertext
system. Competing technical standards are promoted for commercial rather than
engineering reasons and some are so complex they're practically useless. Alas,
Javascript is <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">hopelessly
unintuitive</a> and provides developers with plenty of rope with which to hang
themselves.</p>

<p>Finally, there are political problems.</p>

<p>You can't publish on the web unless you know how to
set up a website or you use a third party service such as a social
network. Social networks are hugely popular but turn the
web into a handful of walled gardens - the antithesis of the decentralised
early web. Furthermore, such websites track and analyse user
behaviour and sell it (via advertising). They also provide services for
storing user's digital assets (in order to harvest yet more data to
sell). As has been
<a href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/11/feudal-security/">pointed out
before</a>, this is deeply worrying.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it is a question of who controls the infrastructure.
Many users are happy to sacrifice privacy and control for ease of use and
convenience. Yet I wonder how many realise that they are tracked and
influenced by only a handful of very powerful technology companies.</p>

<p>What of the future? I like to think that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson">William Gibson</a> was
right when, in 1996
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/14/magazine/the-net-is-a-waste-of-time.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm">he said</a>,</p>

<blockquote>[T]he World Wide Web [is] the test pattern for whatever will become the dominant global medium.</blockquote>

<p>(Who knows what will happen next?)</p>
