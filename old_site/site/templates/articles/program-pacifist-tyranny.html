<h1>Program a Pacifist Tyranny</h1>
<p class="published_on">Tuesday 5th May 2015 (19:00PM)</p>

<p><strong>Edit #1 (6th May 2015):</strong> Upon re-reading this article with
fresh eyes I realise it's very "raw". This is merely a reflection of the
underdeveloped nature of the ideas expressed herein. Put simply, I'm interested
in <em>how programming relates to the exercise of power</em>. Keep that in
mind as you read on. Finally, I welcome feedback, constructive critique and
ideas - it helps these ideas to develop. I will ignore vacuous comments
that state some variation of "you're wrong because I'm right and I know what
I'm talking about". Thoughtful, respectful yet robust argument is always
most welcome! :-)</p>

<p><strong>Edit #2 (9th May 2015):</strong> I've made minor changes to
simplify and clarify several points. I've also improved the flow by correcting
clunky prose.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Violence is a forced curtailment of one's well-being and autonomy, usually
via unwanted physical intervention by a third party.</p>

<p>To be blunt, the threat and eventual use of violence is how government
imposes itself on citizens. In places like the UK, the Government derives its
authority to use such onerous power from its legitimacy as a democratic
institution: the citizens get a say in who is in charge. Laws created by the
legislative and judicial elements of government define the scope of the threat
and use of state-sanctioned violence towards citizens.</p>

<p>Usually violence is not required - the threat suffices. Most people
pay fines associated with a traffic ticket: they understand failure to do so
would end badly for them (arrest followed by prison). Obeying the law is so
ingrained and unquestioningly assumed that it is a habitually formed behaviour
- violence is not even appreciated as part of the context.</p>

<p>Any reasonably intelligent person understands why we have laws:
they help people live together peacefully and, one would hope, in a way that
is consistently equitable and fair. The figure of Lady Justice atop the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Bailey">Old Bailey</a> is the
personification of law as an impartial, objective process without fear nor
favour. Put simply, the law and the veiled threat of violence applies equally
to all.</p>

<p>Except that it obviously doesn't and
<a href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/the-law-is-an-ass.html">the law is
an ass</a> on so many occasions.</p>

<p>There are any number of examples I could use to illustrate bad laws
misapplied in an unequal, prejudicial and discriminatory way. So common is this
unfortunate turn of events that I imagine you could think of your own examples.
As a result, I'm merely going to bring to your attention the case of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a>, a gifted
coder and activist who was hounded by legal authorities in the US until he
committed suicide. I strongly recommend you watch the rather excellent
<a href="http://www.takepart.com/internets-own-boy">The Internet's Own Boy</a>
(embedded below), a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">creative commons</a>
licensed film about these tragic events:</p>

</div>

<p>What do such cases tell us? While the spirit of the law is "blind" and
impartial, the practice and application of the law isn't.</p>

<p>The authorities understand this and realise that technology can help both
in terms of law enforcement and impartiality. For example, in the UK speed
limits on roads are often measured by average-speed-check cameras.</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/average_speed.jpeg"
    alt="Average speed check sign"/></p>

<p>At certain points along a road (and at known distances apart) cameras are
positioned to read car registration number plates. If you average a speed
greater than the advertised limit then you are automatically sent a speeding
ticket.</p>

<p>At no point in <a href="http://www.speedcamerasuk.com/specs.htm">this
process</a> is a human actually involved. The cameras
never tire, they work without prejudice and they apply their machinations to
everyone. Such co-opting of automated computing technology for law
enforcement appears to be on the rise.</p>

<p>What could possibly go wrong?</p>

<p>Since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_%282013%E2%80%93present%29">Snowden revelations</a>
we know that everything we do online is open
to the government. If you're technically savvy enough to correctly use
encryption, such innocent countermeasures become an automatic marker
for the authorities to investigate further. More worryingly, lethal force is
becoming automated through the use of
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/drew-f-cohen/autonomous-drones-and-the_b_4428112.html">autonomous drones</a>
and other similar technologies.</p>

<p>This raises an important question:</p>

<p>Who defines the machinations of such autonomous computing enforcement
devices?</p>

<p>In a sense, programmers do. The code they design and write encapsulates the
behaviour of the speed camera or autonomous drone. Furthermore, with the
increased connectivity and programmability of "stuff" (the so called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things">Internet of
Things</a>) our tools, belongings and infrastructure are increasingly dependent
on code. Our world (more accurately, the things we create in it that make it
comfortable, pleasant and interesting) is becoming programmable. Ergo,
governments have a new mechanism for imposing upon citizens: software.</p>

<p>The sanction to force compliance is no longer violence - the government
can pass laws to program the world to automatically coerce you,
nudge you or persuade you. For instance, imagine a situation where the
car of a flagged suspect is automatically and remotely deactivated until
certain conditions are met (not dissimilar to the Police intervention in
<a href="http://www.schnews.org.uk/archive/news6252.htm">this case</a>).</p>

<p>Governments can legislate to program a pacifist tyranny.</p>

<p>Why pacifist? Because the traditional threat of violence is replaced by a
threat of non-action or (worse) counter-action on the part of your
belongings.</p>

<p>Why tyranny? Because citizens
<a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/04/dmca-ownership-john-deere/">no longer
control or own their belongings</a>. They can't argue with code if it refuses
to start their car, nor can they change such code so it more closely fits their
requirements.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most people don't understand code in much the same way
that medieval serfs couldn't read the Bible (so couldn't question the authority
of the church). It's not that programming is hard, it is simply not a widely
practised skill.</p>

<p>This is why programming is such an essential skill to promote
in education. In order to lead a flourishing self directed life in such a
digitally dominated world we must have control over our digital devices both
in a physical and programmable sense. The alternative is to allow others,
through the code they write, intimate control over our world.</p>

<p>By the way, it's not just governments that exercise this power: any
service that helps you organise your life can do the same. Facebook, Google
and the rest are already trying to modify your behaviour (except they're
trying to get you to spend money rather than obey the law).</p>

<p>How can such a morally suspect state of affairs be foiled?</p>

<p>Our digital world is dominated by centralised entities that hold power and
control over our data and devices. Only by decentralising (to avoid points of
control and coercion) and engaging humanity to learn about and take control of
the computational world will a tyranny of software be averted.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier</a>
<a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20141103-everybody-spies-or-nobody-does">points out</a>,
software itself does not
distinguish morality from legality - it's merely "capability". Yet capability
permits certain forms of behaviour that in turn pose moral, legal and political
questions, requirements and possibilities. Furthermore, we're engineering a
digital world from a certain point of view that is reflected in the
capabilities of the code we create. It is for this reason that writing
software is both an ethical and political activity.</p>

<p>If you're a coder, ask yourself about your own project's capabilities. Work
out how it influences, empowers or diminishes your users. If at all possible,
promote users' <a href="/article/autonomy">personal autonomy</a>.</p>

<p>Technology should help humanity flourish (rather than constrain).</p>
