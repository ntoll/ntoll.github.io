<h1>20 Years</h1>
<p class="published_on">Wednesday 2nd August 2017 (9:00am)</p>

<p>Today is our 20th wedding anniversary. Such an auspicious occasion deserves
celebrating.</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/wedding.jpg" alt="Our wedding day."/></p>

<p>Mary and I face the world together: we laugh with (and at) each other, we
trust each other and we rely on each other. It is a great source of strength
and comfort that the person I love most in the world thinks of me as the person
they love most in the world. It's a virtuous circle of mutual love, support,
friendship and affection. Since this is something only Mary and I share with
each other, it makes it all the more precious.</p>

<p>Yet we find ourselves in a wonderful situation. Our bonds strengthen over
time as our shared experience grows, for example, as parents bringing up our
three children to be confident, independent and flourishing individuals.</p>

<p>We were very fortunate to meet and marry at a young age. Consequently, it's
likely that we have 40 years or more of marriage ahead of us. That's 40 more
years of making memories, having fun and growing old together.</p>

<p>So, here's to our shared future, and long may it last.</p>

<p>(In case you were wondering, we'll hold a big party for all our friends and
family at our 25th anniversary: 2nd August, 2022.)</p>
