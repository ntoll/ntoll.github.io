<p>Last weekend was PyconUK. You can read all about how successful it was
<a href="http://pyconuk.net/PostConf">elsewhere</a>. I want to focus on the
education track: two days that brought together teachers, students and
developers. This was the second year we'd run an education track and this
time round it was sponsored by
<a href="http://corp.bankofamerica.com/">Bank of America</a>.

<p>I've been to many educational conferences, both when I was a teacher and,
more recently, as a developer interested in education. Apart from a few
exceptions I usually feel frustrated by the lack of concrete and tangible
outcomes from such events. They end up as people talking shop and complaining
about the current system concluding with a call to action that "something must
be done (think of the children)".</p>

<p>Of course something must be done.</p>

<p>Such meetings are where one expects plans to come together for
"something to be done". Having the space to reflect with, learn from and
challenge each other is how we discover the concrete details of the
"something to be done". Unfortunately, "something must be done" often turns
into "you can't fight the system" or some other similar acknowledgement of
defeat ("life's too short" and "I'm too busy coping" are two other
variations). This is a shame because such concessions are more a reflection of
a person's point of view than it is on their ability to do something.</p>

<p>So we asked ourselves, "what could be done about this state of affairs?"
and replied with the PyconUK education track.</p>

<p>Our outlook was simple:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Interesting things happen when you bring together a diverse group of
    smart people who are all passionate about the same subject (in this case
    programming in education). Diversity is the antidote to educational
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink">groupthink</a>.</li>

    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus
    Torvalds</a>, the creator of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel">Linux</a> and one of
    the world's most celebrated programmers once said that,
    "<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/8/25/132">talk is cheap, show me
    the code</a>". We wanted to focus on practical and immediately useful
    activities. Close collaboration between teachers and developers was
    key to making this happen (more on this below).</li>

    <li>People work best when they're having fun. Remember your favourite
    teacher? You probably don't think of them because they were good
    at classroom discipline, marking or producing spiffy lesson plans (not
    that these <em>may</em> be important). Rather, I'd wager they were your
    favourite because they infected you with their own enthusiasm for their
    subject. We wanted teachers, students and developers to leave PyconUK in
    a highly contagious state.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I watched this video from teacher
<a href="http://about.me/benllewellynsmith">Ben Smith</a> I knew we'd struck
gold.<p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qOya5R9g1T8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Here we have teachers and developers collaborating, asking questions of
each other (there's no such thing as a stupid question in this situation) and
producing something that can be easily adapted to work in the classroom.</p>

<p>Another highlight from the teachers was
<a href="https://twitter.com/vikkiville">Vikki Dodd</a> and her colleagues
eloquently describing to the massed ranks of programmers the sort of hurdles,
expectations and successes that a UK teacher of ICT encounters. I'm proud to
say the most common response from the developers was, "how can we help?" to
which the answer was to
<a href="http://www.stemnet.org.uk/content/ambassadors">become a STEM
ambassador</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/">Martin O'Hanlon</a> deserves a
special mention since his contribution brought everyone together in the most
practical of ways: he inspired us by describing how to use
<a href="http://pi.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> as a sort of programmable
digital Lego via <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> and a
<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>. In the video below
Martin succinctly describes and shows us what we got up to.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JRMbKHb4ixo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>We wanted to involve kids in our education track because many of us
organising and attending PyconUK were first inspired by programming when we
were kids. Put simply, we wanted to inspire the next generation of programmers
by letting them play with code in the company of contagious teachers and
expert Pythonistas.</p>

<p>Happily PyconUK has been graced by the presence of
<a href="http://about.me/AlanODonohoe">Alan O'Donohoe</a> for three years in
a row. He's a fellow Pythonista and, more importantly, an inspiring teacher
who is the source of the world-wide phenomenon known as
<a href="http://raspberryjam.org.uk/">Raspberry Jam</a>. We had, in our midst,
the most qualified person in the world to pull off an inspiring day of
programming for kids.</p>

<p>We were not let down.</p>

<p>Rather than describe what went on I think it best to let the kids (young
and old) tell us themselves:</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u4IMlpmjbYg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PXPoc9HCTlo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RZJFdeDpo8w?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Alan also <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/102569475330772729673/albums/5926578135551904161">took some photographs of the event</a>.</p>

<p>I'd like to finish with two points:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The gender split among the kids was 50/50. This bodes well.</li>
    <li>Everyone who attended PyconUK 2013 (be they teachers or students
    learning Python, or developers learning how to teach) learned by
    doing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">dead Greek philosopher</a>
was right. Rather than talking about things, collaboratively doing stuff leads
to tangible and concrete results like infecting teachers, students and
developers with an enthusiasm for programming.</p>

<p>In case you're wondering, we'll be repeating the education track next year.
It'll be one of many events where teachers, students and developers come
together to collaboratively inspire each other. Why not try Alan's next
<a href="https://rjamboree14.eventbrite.co.uk/">Raspberry Jamboree</a> if you
want to get involved..?</p>
