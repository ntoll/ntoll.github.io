<h1>Data and Databases ~ Concise and Simple</h1>
<p class="published_on">Thursday 14th February 2013 (08:00AM)</p>

<p>(As with all "<a href="/article/concise-and-simple">concise and simple</a>"
articles I assume no prior knowledge of the subject and keep the length to
less than 1500 words.)</p>

<blockquote>
"Scientia potentia est." (Knowledge is power.)
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon">Sir Francis Bacon</a>.</p>
<p>In the digital world knowledge is stored, in its latent form, as data in
databases. Everyone from your local
<a href="http://www.tesco.com/clubcard/clubcard/">supermarket</a> to the
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/">government</a> collects data about <em>all of
us</em>. Information and knowledge is extracted about all aspects of
our lives, from our shopping habits to whether we've paid our taxes (it is no
accident that the examples above relate to extracting money from us). According
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/04/schmidt-data/"> to Google</a> it
currently takes just two days for us to generate as much information as was
created by all of humanity from the dawn of time until 2003.</p>

<p>This article is about data and databases - the technology that makes the
accumulation and analysis of this flood of information possible. It starts with
a simple question: what is data?</p>

<p>"Data" are values that convey meaningful information about something.
Meaning is implied by the context and structure of the data. Structure is
formed from the way data is represented. Databases simply store and provide
mechanisms for working with structured data.</p>

<p>The most fundamental data-related act is to name a value:</p>

<p><pre><code class="python">my_name = "Nicholas Tollervey"</code></pre></p>

<p>My name <em>is</em> Nicholas Tollervey. This is shown by
"<code>my_name</code>" being assigned the value "<em>Nicholas Tollervey</em>".
Assignment happens when a <em>token name</em> is followed by an <em>equals
</em> sign that is, in turn, followed by a <em>value</em>. Notice the three
layers: meaning, structure and representation.</p>

<p>Another example:</p>

<p><pre><code class="python">nicholas = {
    "first_name": "Nicholas",
    "middle_name": "Harry",
    "surname": "Tollervey",
    "birthday": {
        "year": 1973,
        "month": 8,
        "day": 19
    }
    "height": 180,
    "weight": 76.9
}</code></pre></p>

<p>After reading the above I'm certain you'll know when to send me a birthday
card. Something called <code>nicholas</code> has a single value associated with
it: an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array">associative
array</a>. Associative arrays are <em>key / value</em> pairs - like a
dictionary of words or a subject index at the back of a book. In this case it
has six entries, one of which is itself a nested associative array with three
entries. It's an associative array because it is enclosed by
curly braces and contains a list of <code>"key_name": value</code> pairs
separated by commas. The associative array is assigned to <code>nicholas</code>
in exactly the same way as the first example (<em>token name</em> followed by
<em>equals</em> followed by <em>value</em>).</p>

<p>Incidentally, I can retrieve my data like this:</p>

<p><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; my_name
"Nicholas Tollervey"
&gt;&gt;&gt; nicholas["height"]
180</code></pre></p>

<p>(This example uses the <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>
programming language: I type in commands after the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
prompt and the Python interpreter replies on the new line.)</p>

<p>A final example:</p>

<table>
    <caption>People</caption>
    <tr>
        <th>id</th>
        <th>first_name</th>
        <th>middle_name</th>
        <th>surname</th>
        <th>nationality_id</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>Nicholas</td>
        <td>Harry</td>
        <td>Tollervey</td>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>Terry</td>
        <td>Charles Oliver</td>
        <td>Jones</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>Esteve</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>Fernandez</td>
        <td>3</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<table>
    <caption>Nationalities</caption>
    <tr>
        <th>id</th>
        <th>name</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>Australian</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>British</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>Spanish</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Obviously, I'm British and my buddies
<a href="https://twitter.com/terrycojones">Terry</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/esteve">Esteve</a> are
Australian and Spanish (respectively). You know this because you understand how
to read tabular information and spot the relationship between the values in the
<code>nationality_id</code> column of the <em>People</em> table and the values
in the <code>id</code> column of the <em>Nationalities</em> table. You know
it's tabular information because it's a two dimensional grid with the
vertical columns indicating named fields and horizontal rows representing
individual records. Once again: meaning, structure, representation.</p>

<p>Each example is more complex than the one preceding it. The first is a
single key / value pair (where <code>my_name</code> is the key and
"<em>Nicholas Tollervey</em>" is the value), the second is a key
(<code>nicholas</code>) associated with a value that is itself key / value
pairs (the associative array). Finally, the third example contains rows of
items that all share the same keys (a.k.a. columns) but different values. Each
type of record (people, nationalities etc) has its own table.</p>

<p>How do such meaningful data structures / representations relate to
databases?</p>

<p>There are four basic actions that all databases may perform on data:
<em>create</em>, <em>read</em>, <em>update</em> and <em>delete</em> (often
expressed as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>).
There are many types of database that meet this minimum functionality. The
three data examples illustrate the types of data structure stored in three of
the most popular types of database: key / value stores (such as
<a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> or
<a href="http://www.memcached.org/">Memcached</a>), document oriented databases
(like <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> or
<a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a>) and relational databases
(for example, <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a> or
<a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>).</p>

<p>Key / value databases are, at heart, associative arrays. They provide three
basic actions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Assign a value to a key (both creating and updating).</li>
    <li>Read a value associated with a known key.</li>
    <li>Delete a value using a known key.</li>
</ul>

<p>Such simple databases are extremely fast and well suited for tasks where
speed is of the essence. However, there isn't a simple way to search the stored
values and keys must be known before being used to retrieve or delete
associated values. Nevertheless, they are extremely useful as caches of
arbitrary values. If you want to try such a database you should visit the
<a href="http://try.redis.io/">try redis tutorial</a> tutorial ~ a gentle yet
comprehensive tour of a popular key / value store.</p>

<p>Document oriented databases store arbitrarily structured documents
expressed as associative arrays. Every document has a unique ID created by the
database and used as a key to reference the document.</p>

<p>However, documents are not opaque values as in key / value databases.
Rather, it is possible to <em>reach in to the documents</em> and construct
queries that reference the document's named attributes (keys). For example,
given a <em>people</em> database I could create a query to retrieve all
documents that have a <em>height</em> attribute with a value greater or equal
to 180.  Since the structure of the documents is arbitrary, such queries rely
on conventions (all <em>people</em> documents have a <em>height</em> attribute
whose value is expressed in centimetres).</p>

<p>Because document structure is not fixed (except by convention), new fields
can be added at any time and document oriented databases specify default
handling for missing fields - usually they'll evaluate to <code>null</code>
(unknown).</p>

<p>To play with a document oriented database, explore the MongoDB
tutorial on the project's
<a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">homepage</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database">Relational
databases</a> developed from the work of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.F._Codd">Edgar Codd</a>. They store
data in rows
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple">tuples</a>) that share the same
columns
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_(computing)">attributes</a>)
defined in tables
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_(database)">relations</a>) -
bracketed words are the formal terminology for the colloquially named
concepts. Each row contains a special field called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Key">primary key</a> (the
<code>id</code> column in the example) that uniquely identifies the record.
Tables, representing different sorts of things, are related to each other with
special fields called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key">foreign keys</a> that
reference primary keys of rows in different tables (the
<code>nationality_id</code>). Many relational databases also enforce
constraints such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_integrity">referential
integrity</a> - where foreign keys may not refer to non-existent primary
keys.</p>

<p>To work efficiently, data in relational databases should be
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization">normalised</a>
to avoid duplication. Data need only be stored in one table
representing a specific type of thing. Therefore, modifications only happen
once and are propagated via the relationships between tables. For example, the
<em>nationalities</em> table is the only place where nationalities may be
defined. Tables for things with nationalities (such as <em>people</em>) need
only reference the single <em>nationalities</em> table via a foreign key rather
than duplicate such information. The process of normalisation usually has
three steps of increasing efficiency:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_normal_form">first</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_normal_form">second</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form">third</a> normal
forms. Sometimes it is necessary to de-normalise a database for performance
reasons - it's faster to retrieve a single row than it is to retrieve several
related rows from different tables.</p>

<p>Structured Query Language
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>) is the programming
language used by relational databases to work with data. Based upon
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra">relational
algebra</a>, it provides CRUD functionality and capabilities for
specifying the structure and relationships between data. It's easy to create
powerful queries:</p>

<p><pre><code class="sql">SELECT people.first_name, people.surname, nationalities.name
FROM people
JOIN nationalities ON nationalities.id = people.nationality_id
WHERE people.surname = "Jones"</code></pre></p>

<p>The result of which is:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>people.first_name</th>
        <th>people.surname</th>
        <th>nationalities.name</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Terry</td>
        <td>Jones</td>
        <td>Australian</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>The query asks: give me the first name, surname and nationality (line 1) of
people whose surname is "Jones" (line 4). We have to specify where to collect
this data (line 2) and how to join the related tables together (line 3). Notice
that SQL doesn't specify how to run the query but describes what the expected
result should be.</p>

<p>Interactions with a database happen as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction">transactions</a>.
Transactions can contain many different commands and should have several
desirable properties:</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>Atomicity</em> - transactions are an all-or-nothing affair that
    cannot be abandoned in an incomplete state.</li>
    <li><em>Consistency</em> - transactions fail if they attempt to
    put the database in to an invalid state such as breaking referential
    integrity or some other constraint.</li>
    <li><em>Isolation</em> - each transaction is independent of and cannot
    interfere with any of the others.</li>
    <li><em>Durability</em> - once complete a transaction's effect will
    remain despite catastrophic events like power failure, crashes or
    errors.</li>
</ul>

<p>A database is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">ACID</a> compliant if its
transactions meet these standards.</p>

<p>The pace of change in data-based technology is fast. Relatively recent
trends, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data">big
data</a> (huge data sets and the technology needed to manage them), deserve
their own article. Yet, even the technology described above allows
companies and governments to build frighteningly accurate pictures of our
lives (how do you think Amazon is able to make such useful suggestions?).</p>

<p>Personally, I find the ubiquitous analysis and measurement of our behaviour
inadvertently Orwellian. Furthermore, there is a tendency to trust the results
obtained from databases without recognizing the <em>meaning</em> level of
data relies on interpretation (of which there are many varieties).
Nevertheless, there are great opportunities to do good and I am reminded of the
Buddhist proverb,</p>

<blockquote>
"To every man is given the key to the gates of heaven; the same key opens the
gates of hell."
</blockquote>

<p>I hope we choose the right gate.</p>
