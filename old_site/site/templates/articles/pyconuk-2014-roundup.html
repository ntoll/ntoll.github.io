<h1>PyconUK 2014 Round Up</h1>
<p class="published_on">Saturday 11th October (5:30PM)</p>

<p><small>(This write-up is a bit late: I've been ill and we've recently had a
death in the family.)</small></p>

<p>This year was the biggest ever <a href="http://pyconuk.org/">PyCon UK</a>
conference - a community organised event for users of the
<a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> programming language. Just under 500
tickets were booked including 45 for teachers and 75 for kids. We couldn't
have done it without the support of the sponsors, especially
<a href="http://corp.bankofamerica.com/">Bank of America</a>, the
<a href="https://www.python.org/psf/">Python Software Foundation</a>
and <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a> without
whom the education track would not have been possible.</p>

<p>For me, the person responsible for the education track, I had most fun
working with the teachers and kids who turned up. I also seemed to be giving
far too many presentations (four in total during PyCon UK). I also realised,
due to circumstances beyond my control, that I have many kind and generous
friends in the Python community and that when disaster strikes people step up
and make "stuff" happen even at 4 o'clock in the morning!</p>

<p>It was a privilege to watch several masters at work during the education
track:</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/resources/teach/">education
team</a> from the RaspberryPi Foundation are insane, inspiring and intelligent
in equal measure - if you can attend one of their free
<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/picademy/">Picademy</a> events for
teachers than you're in for a real treat. It's easy to sound bombastic
about the work of the Raspberry Pi Foundation (so allow me to demonstrate):
the pedagogical forces that they unleash are both unique (because who'd have
thought such a small, cheap and "raw" piece of kit would result in such a
huge amount of interest) and important (because the Raspberry Pi liberates
computing education from the boring sad little world of locked down RM boxes,
presentations and spreadsheets). That they are a UK based effort makes it all
the more important that we, the UK's Python community, give them as much of
our support as possible.</p>

<p>It was also wonderful to see
<a href="http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/">Martin O'Hanlon</a> work his
Minecraft magic on both teachers and students. Martin introduces Python
programming via only a handful of very simple Minecraft related concepts that
he uses to build some amazing things within the Minecraft world (his
in-game house that follows you around was a big hit with the kids). He's so
good at this sort of thing that
he's <a href="http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-111894691X.html">written a book</a>
on this very subject (that's bound to be a big hit with young programmers and
teachers alike - what an inspiring textbook <strong>that</strong> would be).
In case you can't wait for its publication you can

<p>(Here's a photo of Martin and fellow author Carrie Anne looking like the
cartoon versions of themselves used in their books.)</p>

<p>I was especially pleased to welcome
<a href="http://splashofcreativity.co.uk/">John Pinkney</a> and his
<a href="https://asknao.aldebaran.com/">NAO</a> robots. I met John at a
<a href="http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/">CAS</a>
hub meeting over the summer where he described how he uses
robots as a catalyst for all sorts of interesting educational activities.
The visual programming tool used to interact with the robots strikes me as
particularly child-friendly. Interestingly the code behind the visual building
blocks used to describe the robot's behaviour is all written in Python (and
thus handily gave me an excuse to invite John to PyCon UK). John gave two
workshops (one for teachers, the other for kids) and the fact that he managed
to keep both groups in rapt awe for an hour is testament to both his
skill as a teacher and the "charisma" of the robots. We also ran a
robot code dojo at which we let the developers play with the bots. I gave a
quick overview of the Python API to the assembled developers and my slides
can be

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/davidames">Dave Ames</a> also deserves a
special mention for leading a couple of excellent
workshops on using the <a href="http://pygame.org/">PyGame</a> project. Dave's
workshops involved taking an existing (yet broken / unfinished) game and
modifying the code to fix things and make it your own. I <em>really like this
approach</em> since it gives students an existing base to work from. It also
makes sure that beginner coders begin the think about debugging their own and
other people's code (for which we provided all attendees with a PyCon UK
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">Debug Duck</a>.
This rather excellent state of affairs is wonderfully encapsulated in the
following video from the kids' day:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/teknoteacher">Alan O'Donohoe</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/ManchesterBudo">Ben Smith</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/vikkiville">Vikki Dodd</a> are three teachers without which
the education track would not function. Alan's pragmatic encouragement when
disaster struck (twice) was invaluable and Ben and Vikki made innumerable
contributions throughout the event that meant I was regularly thinking, "Oh
wow, [Ben/Vikki] has already done that." That's what I mean when I say that
people "step up".</p>

<p>It was an immense privilege and a lot of fun to work with
<a href="https://twitter.com/NaomiCeder">Naomi Ceder</a> (founder
of the PyCon US Education Summit) on our own small contribution to the
education track: introducing object oriented programming to teachers
<a href="/static/presentations/oopy/index.html">through the medium of
cows</a>. I especially enjoyed the tag wrestling modus operandi of our talk.
I'll leave you to guess which one of us was Big Daddy or Giant Haystacks (a
UK specific cultural reference I'm sure Naomi will be delighted to quickly
forget). In any case, both teachers and developers got stuck into our
Parrot related exercise (as the picture below shows):</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://twitter.com/MissPhilbin">Carrie Anne</a> gave
a stonking keynote address to the whole conference on Sunday afternoon. I've
heard far too many
boring-yet-worthy-important-people-talking-about-boring-yet-worthy-important-things
as conference keynotes in my time. Happily it soon became apparent that Carrie
Anne's keynote was definitely <strong>not</strong> a boring-yet-worthy talk
about matters of an educational nature. If you want
to actually know what Carrie Anne said you should invite her to
your conference to give the keynote. It would be definitely worth it:
evidence via social networks suggests hers was the warmest
received and most highly regarded keynote of this year's conference.</p>

<p>Other wonderful aspects of this year's PyCon UK included the beer for the
conference meal (brewed using Python), the charity cheese shop that raised
several hundred pounds for a local children's hospice and the inevitable
silliness during the lightning talks.</p>

<p>Finally, it was a pleasure to catch up with
<a href="https://twitter.com/VanL">Van Lindberg</a> (chair of the Python
Software Foundation). I'll leave what we discussed for a separate blog post
but, in the meantime, you should all totally sign up to be members of the
PSF <a href="https://www.python.org/accounts/signup/">here</a>. Why?
Because,</p>

<blockquote>
The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.
</blockquote>

<p>We've already started planning next year's conference. If you can think of
any ways in which we can make it better please don't hesitate to get in
touch.</p>
