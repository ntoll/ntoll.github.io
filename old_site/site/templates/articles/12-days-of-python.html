<h1>The Twelve Days of Python</h1>
<p class="published_on">Saturday 1st December 2012 (09:30AM)</p>

<p>One of my less pleasant pass-times is butchering the English language with
dodgy verse. I already have a track record
<a href="https://github.com/ntoll/fuzzymandias">wrangling well known poems</a>
for friends or
<a href="https://github.com/ntoll/programmer_pythonical">re-hashing
libretto</a> for vocal performance.</p>

<p>Last week, in the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=python-uk&uio=d4">#python-uk</a>
IRC channel, there was discussion of what a Pythonic Christmas carol would
look like.</p>

<p>Today, given that it's the season of peace and goodwill to all men (and
women), I've decided to ignore that sentiment and publish what is, perhaps, my
most diabolical creation yet. I give you, "The Twelve Days of Python" (sung to
the tune of... well, I'm sure you can figure it out):</p>
