<p><a href="https://ep2020.europython.eu/">EuroPython</a> took place last month and the
raw video footage of the talks has just been published online. EuroPython has
always been one of my favourite conferences and is a special place for me:
it's where I gave my first ever programming talk back in 2010. It's also one of
the most culturally cosmopolitan coding conferences and was the world's
first community organised Python software conference. I always come away
feeling enriched by EuroPython.</p>
<p>Thanks, as always, to the volunteer organisers who work so hard to bring about
this remarkable event. Such thanks are especially well deserved in 2020 since
it was held online due to the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The potential for
technical mishaps and problems was huge, yet the friendly and supportive team
behind the conference ensured a slick and engaging event.</p>
<p>As always, there were many great talks with a particular highlight for me being
a fascinating explanation of building "artistic artefacts" (computer generated
pictures in the style of human painters) with
<a href="https://ep2020.europython.eu/talks/BSeL2FG-painting-with-gans-challenges-and-technicalities-of-neural-style-transfer/">Generative Adversarial Networks</a>.</p>
<p>However, I sorely missed the corridor track - when you walk around the physical
conference venue and bump into an old buddy, find yourself striking up a
conversation with a friendly co-attendee in the coffee queue, or join a huddle
of welcoming folks discussing something interesting. The corridor track is
where the community comes alive. I'll have more to say about this in a
moment...</p>
<p>I was delighted to make two contributions to this year's conference.</p>
<p>The first was a wonderful opportunity to bring some music to the conference. My
friend and EuroPython's own force of nature,
<a href="https://www.malemburg.com/marc-andre-lemburg">Marc-André</a> got in touch
to say that they were looking for musical contributions to a "jam session". I
have, on several occasions, inflicted my love of tubas on Marc-André so
he knew I used to be a professional classical musician. I can only assume his 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzJZObBSU7E">Germanic inclination for oompah-bands</a>
was at the back of his mind when he reached out. I responded that tuba music is
"rather niche" at the best of times, let alone as part of a "jam session".
Nevertheless, I agreed to contribute something, "perhaps a piece of classical
piano music?" (since I'd been playing lots of piano during lock-down here in
the UK).</p>
<p>In the end, I went for some
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Brahms">Brahms</a> ~ an
<a href="https://www.mfiles.co.uk/scores/brahms-intermezzo-op118-no2.pdf">Intermezzo</a>
written "as a token of friendship" for his friend, the concert pianist and
composer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Schumann">Clara Schumann</a>. It's
my musical token of friendship towards everyone at EuroPython.</p>
<p>I hope you like it.</p>

</div>

<p>My second contribution was
<a href="https://ep2020.europython.eu/talks/AGaSaW8-how-to-run-a-corridor-track-in-a-remote-conference-with-python/">a presentation</a>.
The slides I prepared, including the links to all the resources I mention
<a href="static/presentations/textsmith_ep2020/index.html#/">can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>The presentation is an exploration of how one might recreate a remote corridor
track via the internet. I think it speaks for itself (honestly, go watch it, I
had a lot of fun preparing and presenting it).</p>

</div>

<p>The summary is that I feel deeply uncomfortable about the way friendships,
conversation and community are mediated in a technical context at this moment
in time. This is something we should be especially concerned about given how
much of our interactions have taken place online during these times of virus
related lock-down.</p>
<p>I offer a quick explanation of what I find so uncomfortable about the current
state of the art and look into the history of computing for other, more humane,
respectful (of users) and creative means of communication via computers.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I describe how I'm using Python to recreate a programmable
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUD</a> (a multi-user, real time text based
virtual world) based upon ideas first explored in the late 1970s and which I
encountered in both the 1980s (while at school) and in the mid-1990s (when I
was at university). Such creations were famous for their mazes of twisty
passages that players could explore and inhabit together.</p>
<p>If you've never heard of MUDs before, here's
<a href="https://mud.co.uk/richard/">Richard Bartle</a> (one of the authors of the
original MUD and author of the
<a href="https://mud.co.uk/dvw/">bible for virtual worlds</a>) describing an old
technology for talking directly to the imagination...  </p>

</div>

<p>As always, I love feedback, comments and constructive criticism offered in good
faith. Assuming the lock-downs have eased, next year's EuroPython will be in
Dublin, Éire.</p>
<p>I love Ireland. Can't wait!</p>
<p>See you at next year's EuroPython!</p>

<p>I've spent today updating everything to do with ntoll.org. Many
thanks to my buddy <a href="https://kushaldas.in/">Kushal Das</a> for the invaluable
advice on various technical matters.</p>
<p>Here's what I've done:</p>
<ol>
<li>The website is run using <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> ~ a Python based
   static site generator. It was <em>very</em> easy to migrate away from my previous
   hand-coded solution made with a custom
   <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/">Flask</a> script and HTML.</li>
<li>It's hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> which is both free
   and makes it very easy to manage code and deployment.</li>
<li>I've switched email hosting to <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a>, who 
   made the whole migration process extraordinarily easy. </li>
<li>I've archived the code for the old website for "safe keeping", even though
   all the content has moved over to the new site.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lots of things have changed in addition to my own technical infrastructure.</p>
<p>I've just finished a very busy period of freelance work with two clients -
the <a href="https://freedom.press/">Freedom of the Press Foundation</a> for whom I
contributed Python code to an
<a href="https://securedrop.org/">application for journalists</a>, and
<a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/">NHSDigital</a> for whom I fulfilled the remote role of a
code mentor / developer coach (like an agile coach, but much more technical).
I was collaborating with a team of Java developers who were learning Python and
Django while building APIs for internal customers and users. I also provided
Python training, which was very rewarding since I love teaching and the
NHSDigital folks were already technically very strong and lots of fun. Both
teams were exceptionally talented and friendly. I had a blast and made lots of
new friends.</p>
<p>In just over a week I'll be starting a new gig with the
<a href="https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/">Ministry of Justice</a> as a senior Python
engineer. I'm <em>really</em> looking forward to this since the work is useful,
interesting and challenging. I'm looking forward to learning from my new
colleagues and making contributions to our collective effort.</p>
<p>What does this mean for all my other projects (for instance
<a href="https://codegrades.com/">CodeGrades</a> or <a href="https://codewith.mu/">Mu</a>)..?
Ironically, I believe I'll have more rhythm to my day and so my work on these
projects will continue in my own time, but at a more predictable pace. Watch
this space. :-)</p>
<p>Finally, the current Corona virus pandemic is affecting life in rather
unforeseen ways: my daughter and older son have had their summer exams
cancelled. Apparently, their results will be based upon their predicted grades.
It means my daughter is going to read Mathematics at university with a
scholarship (dependent on her achieving her target grades, which she will in
light of the current situation) and my son will have the grades needed to go
onto study Physics, Maths, Music and Design Technology at "A" level (his
current plan is to read engineering at university). My youngest son continues
school lessons, completed at home via an online platform.</p>
<p>We've also had to purchase some home-studio equipment (mics, pre-amp, monitor
speakers, midi keyboard and related audio software). Mary, my wife, uses this
to teach her many instrumental students remotely via video calls. It soon
became apparent that laptop or mobile phone mics are not great for cello
or piano teaching. Happily, the new equipment is proving to be a great success
and Mary is able to continue teaching most students without disruption and from
the comfort of our own music room:</p>
<p><img alt="Our home studio" src="images/studio.jpg"></p>
<p>It also means <em>I</em> have the equipment available to produce my own (Python)
training materials and the kids are having a great time mixing all sorts of
different types of music.</p>
<p>Here's hoping you stay safe and remain healthy during this challenging time.
Since most of us are in lock-down, don't hesitate to get in touch if you fancy
a chat..! Social distancing rules don't mean you have to be anti-social.</p>

    <p>The majority of the code I write is given away for free for the benefit of
others. This is unsustainable so I often think about how such voluntary work
could be supported. One solution is related to my
<a href="http://codegrades.com/">CodeGrades</a> idea. But this is a slow
burn project that has involved, and continues to demand, a huge amount of
time, effort and money before I'll have anything to show for it.</p>

<p>Another solution is simply to ask folks for money.</p>

<p>Having been a musician, I'm used to this feeling. I used to busk with some
buddies as a way of trying to make ends meet. However, as my grandmother once
pointed out, it's a form of begging. In one sense, this is a tragedy: begging
is a last resort because nothing else you do is of value. You're forced to
rely on the compassion and generosity of others. Yet in another sense it's like
the activity of a mendicant asking for alms for their service or contributions
to society. In any case, no matter how you "spin" it, it's a precarious
situation to find oneself in ~ be you a musician or free software developer
(and I'm both!).</p>

<p>While there are some kind hearted individuals and (even rarer) companies or
organisations who are happy to help support such work, most think, "meh, I'll
just use the software" (without so much as a thank you). Even worse (and I have
personal experience of this) some folks will pass off such voluntary work as
their own and reap the rewards for such a lie. This is why I actually earn
money-to-live by writing software as a freelance developer (it gives me the
flexibility I need to work on my own coding projects).</p>

<p>Therefore, it was with some interest that I noticed GitHub had created what
they describe as account sponsorship. "Sponsorship" is an interesting word
to use because it makes the begging / mendicant aspect of the situation more
palatable. It also cheerfully suggests that the free/open-source software world
is full of generous hearted folks or organisations just waiting to give back to
the selfless volunteers who make all this code available via their GitHub
account.</p>

<p>This is, of course, a fiction. It's also normalising begging as a solution
to funding free software volunteers.</p>

<p>But I'm open minded and willing to give anything a go, especially if it
means it'll cover my costs. So I've signed up and now <em>you</em> can give me
money for my efforts. As of the time of writing, and after tweeting about this
to my 3,000+ followers, this is what my account looks like:</p>

<p>
<img src="static/images/github_sponsors.png" style="border: 1px solid #ccc;"></p>

<p>I can't help but think that in six months time, it'll still look the same.
But at least I can say I gave it a go. Despite my misgivings, I feel it
important to give ideas a chance to flower and I'm trying very hard (yet
failing) to view this as a mendicant rather than beggar.</p>

<p>So, if you've ever found my work or activities useful, beneficial or
supportive, please consider helping me sustain my efforts. You can do so by
visiting my "<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/ntoll">sponsorship</a>"
page to find out more about what I do and how to give "alms". The summary is
that I focus on education: I develop software that helps folks learn the
skills and knowledge they need to imagine, develop and program the stuff they
want. If you believe this is important work, sponsor me with a monthly
contribution.</p>

<p>Alternatively, and many thanks to the small number of you who have already
done this, you can send me a virtual hug-as-a-book by buying me
something from my <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/3B63FUSVDIJJS">Amazon wish list</a>
(none of the items are particularly expensive). Small gestures, such as gifting
books or music with a supportive message, can actually mean a lot.</p>

<p>I'll report back in a few months to let you know how I get on. I have to
admit, I don't hold out much hope. Best knuckle down on CodeGrades.</p>

<p>Well... what are you waiting for..? Go on... get your wallets out. :-)</p>

<p>(Honestly, I quite understand if you don't. I have the same misgivings
you're probably having after reading the sentence above. Such a feeling is the
nub of what I want to demonstrate in this blog post.)</p>
